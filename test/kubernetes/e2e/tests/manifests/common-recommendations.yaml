# This file defines the common recommendations for a user who wants to run kgateway.
# These should be reviewed and tested before being adopted.
#
# NOTE TO MAINTAINERS:
# Our Helm API has a set of default values. In most cases, we chose to not default _new_ APIs as a way
# of maintaining backwards compatibility. However, a side effect of that is that ideal configuration
# is not the default. That is where this file comes in.
# In this file we define any values which are not the default, but are the recommended pattern of installing,
# and thus testing, kgateway. Any values in this file should ideally be converted into
# defaults in our values-template.yaml overtime. That way, users of the product can have the easiest experience,
# and gain the best value, without custom configuration.

# Configuration for the kgateway controller pod
controller:
  # we need to be able to troubleshoot failures using logs; when users encounter problems enabling debug logging is
  # a very early step in the troubleshooting process
  logLevel: debug
# TODO enable other values
  # deployment:
  #   livenessProbeEnabled: true
  #   customEnv:
  #     # We scale the Gloo component frequently in tests, and need leadership to be established quickly
  #     # Therefore, we set values to lower thresholds than the defaults
  #     - name: LEADER_ELECTION_LEASE_DURATION
  #       value: 4s
  #     - name: LEADER_ELECTION_RENEW_PERIOD
  #       value: 3s
  #     - name: LEADER_ELECTION_RETRY_PERIOD
  #       value: 1s
  #   # Resource requests and limits should be identified by users directly
  #   # We define them here to ensure that tests can pass with resources defined
  #   resources:
  #     requests:
  #       #  We have limited GitHub action resources which can cause containers to not create
  #       # therefore we lessen the cpu resource requests values from the default (500m) to 100m.
  #       cpu: 100m
  #       memory: 256Mi
  #     limits:
  #       cpu: 1000m
  #       memory: 10Gi
  #   stats:
  #     enabled: true # enable stats server for gloo so we can collect the metrics in CI

# TODO Configuration for the dynaimcally deployed proxies
    # Panic mode allows Envoy load balancing to disregard host's health status.
    # With panic mode enabled, it's possible that breaking changes to our health status configuration will still pass CI.
    # As a result, we disable panic mode in our tests. This is not necessarily a recommendation for users running kgateway,
    # but is a way of ensuring that our tests are validating health status configuration properly
    # healthyPanicThreshold: 0
    # podTemplate:
    #   # Enable a readiness probe
    #   probes: true
    #   # Enable a liveness probe
    #   livenessProbeEnabled: true
    #   # Graceful shutdown allows Envoy to begin failing healthchecks (that have been configured via the health check filter)
    #   # and then sleep for a certain, customized amount of time.
    #   # This is particularly when kgateway is running behind some external load-balancer, and we need to signal
    #   # to that load balancer that the proxies should stop receiving traffic, without affecting the current traffic on the pods
    #   gracefulShutdown:
    #     enabled: true
    #     # This functionality isn't relied upon in our tests, but it's a good practice to define it,
    #     # so we configure it here as an example
    #     sleepTimeSeconds: 1
    #   resources:
    #     requests:
    #       #  We have limited GitHub action resources which can cause containers to not create
    #       # therefore we lessen the cpu resource requests values from the default (500m) to 100m.
    #       cpu: 100m
    #       memory: 256Mi
