title: Installing Gloo
weight: 2
---

## 1. Install Glooctl

If this is your first time running Gloo, you’ll need to download the command-line interface (CLI) onto your local machine. 
You’ll use this CLI to interact with Gloo, including installing it onto your Kubernetes cluster.

To install the CLI, run:

`curl -sL https://run.solo.io/gloo/install | sh`

Alternatively, you can download the CLI directly via the github releases page. 

Next, add Gloo to your path with:

`export PATH=$HOME/.gloo/bin:$PATH`

Verify the CLI is installed and running correctly with:

`glooctl --version`

## 2. Choosing a deployment option

There currently exist several options for deploying Gloo depending on your use case and 
deployment platform.

- [*Gateway*](#gateway): Gloo's full feature set is 
available via its v1/Gateway API. The Gateway API is modeled on Envoy's own API with the use of opinionated defaults 
to make complex configurations possible, while maintaining simplicity where desired.

- [*Ingress*](#ingress): Gloo will support configuration the Kubernetes Ingress resource, acting as a Kubernetes Ingress Controller. 
Note that ingress objects must have the annotation `"kubernetes.io/ingress.class": "gloo"` to be processed by the Gloo Ingress.

- [*Knative*](#knative): Gloo will integrate 
automatically with Knative as a cluster-level ingress for [*Knative-Serving*](https://github.com/knative/serving). 
Gloo can be used in this way as a lightweight replacement for Istio when using Knative-Serving.

### 2a. Install the Gloo Gateway to your Kubernetes Cluster using Glooctl
        
Once your Kubernetes cluster is up and running, run the following command to deploy the Gloo Gateway to the `gloo-system` namespace:

```bash
glooctl install gateway 
```

Check that the Gloo pods and services have been created:

```bash
kubectl get all -n gloo-system

### 2b. Install the Gloo Ingress Controller to your Kubernetes Cluster using Glooctl

Once your Kubernetes cluster is up and running, run the following command to deploy the Gloo Ingress to the `gloo-system` namespace:

```bash
glooctl install ingress 
```

### 2c. Install the Gloo Knative Cluster Ingress to your Kubernetes Cluster using Glooctl

 
Once your Kubernetes cluster is up and running, run the following command to deploy Knative-Serving components to the `knative-serving` namespace and Gloo to the `gloo-system` namespace:

`glooctl install knative`


Check that the Gloo and Knative pods and services have been created:

```bash
kubectl get all -n gloo-system

See [Getting Started with Gloo and Knative](../../user_guides/gloo_with_knative) to get started using Gloo as your Knative Ingress.

### Next steps

Everything should be up and running. If this process does not work, please [open an issue](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/new). We are happy to answer
questions on our [diligently staffed Slack channel](https://slack.solo.io/).


### Uninstall 

To uninstall Gloo and all related components, simply run

```bash
glooctl uninstall
```

Note that this will also remove Knative-Serving, if it was installed by Glooctl.
