Description: Upstream Spec for Consul Upstreams
consul Upstreams represent a set of one or more addressable pods for a consul Service
the Gloo consul Upstream maps to a single service port. Because consul Services support mulitple ports,
Gloo requires that a different upstream be created for each port
consul Upstreams are typically generated automatically by Gloo from the consul API

```yaml
"service_name": string
"service_tags": []string
"service_spec": .plugins.gloo.solo.io.ServiceSpec
"connect_enabled": bool

```
