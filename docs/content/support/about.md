## Solo Support scope

Solo Support offers technical assistance in English for Solo products. We are committed to helping you successfully utilize our software in your production environment by: 

* Addressing specific questions and concerns related to the installation and maintenance of our software.
* Assisting with troubleshooting.
* Helping resolve errors or failures encountered during installation or use of our products.
* Identifying and documenting reported bugs, as well as providing workaround solutions when possible.
* Providing support for the integration between Solo products — Istio included — and third-party software. **Note**: If we identify that the issue is happening on the third-party side, we may redirect you to work with the appropriate vendor, as we do not provide support for other vendor’s software.

All Solo customers have access to various channels for obtaining technical assistance for our software:
* Open a support ticket in the [Support Portal](https://support.solo.io).
* Join the community of Solo users in [Slack](https://soloio.slack.com), or talk to your Account Executive to be added to the private Solo Slack space.
* Contact Solo Support by sending an email to `support@solo.io`. 
* Call the Support Hotline at `+1-601-476-5646` (for **urgent priority, production-related** issues only).

## Not within Solo Support’s scope

Solo Support is not accountable for providing assistance with custom code, third-party tools, or unsupported technologies. Your request is likely out of Solo Support’s scope if it is primarily about:
* Third party integrations, such as Hashicorp Vault
* Writing custom scripts
* Configuration of external authentication systems
* Open source projects (Istio is an exception)

Reach out to your Solo Account Executive or Customer Success Manager if you have questions or require assistance with any of the following: 
* Architecture, design review, and best practices
* Securing your environment
* Comprehensive installation guide
* Help with custom code
* Scheduling or registering for training and workshops

For guidance on what products may be right for you, to request a demo, and to learn more about pricing options, [contact Solo Sales](https://www.solo.io/company/contact-sales/) or reach out to your Account Executive.
