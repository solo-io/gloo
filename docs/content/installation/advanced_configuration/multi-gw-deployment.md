Create multiple Envoy gateway proxies with Gloo Gateway to segregate and customize traffic controls in an environment with multiple types of traffic, such as public internet and a private intranet.

{{% notice note %}}
Gloo Gateway offers an alternative to deploying multiple gateways called [Hybrid Gateways]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/traffic_management/listener_configuration/hybrid_gateway/" >}}). With a hybrid gateway, you can define multiple HTTP or TCP gateways in a single gateway with distinct matching criteria. Hybrid gateways work best in situations where the matching criteria are based on client IP address or SSL config. If so, you can get the benefits of multiple gateways with fewer moving parts and simpler configuration.

## Multiple gateway architecture and terminology

Gloo Gateway offers a flexible architecture by providing custom resource definitions (CRDs) that you can use to configure _proxies_ and _gateways_. These two terms describe the physical and logical architecture of a gateway system.
- **Proxies**: The _physical_ gateways, or reverse proxies, that are running instances of Envoy as the `gateway-proxy` pods in your cluster. You define these gateway proxies in the Helm configuration file when you install or upgrade your Gloo Gateway deployment.
- **Gateways**: The _logical_ gateway that is an Envoy _listener_, which represents a server socket and a protocol. By default, your cluster gets two gateways for handling plain text HTTP and HTTPS connections. To generate more Envoy listeners such as for other protocols, you can create more `Gateway` _Custom Resources_.

See the following diagram for more information about [Custom Resource Usage]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/introduction/architecture/custom_resources/" >}}). The blue squares are Kubernetes _Custom Resources_ (CRs), and the **Gateway** and **Gloo** circles are Kubernetes deployments that function as controllers for the CRs.

For more detail about how the `Gateway` and `Proxy` CRDs interact, review the following diagram and description.

![Gateways and Gateway-proxies]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/gateways-relationship.png" >}})

* From the middle Gateway CRD to the right-hand Proxy and Gateway-Proxy in this diagram: \
 The `Gateway` CRD defines the server host and port that the Envoy listener gateway listens to. \
 The `Proxy` CRs are created automatically by the Gloo controller. Do not modify these CRs. Any changes might interrupt the proxy and are overwritten by the Gloo controller. \
 This setup means you can have several "_Gateways_", Envoy listeners, that are bound to a single "_Proxy_", or Envoy instance. You can use each gateway to differentiate incoming traffic and apply different server configurations, such as creating separate `Gateway` CRs for TLS, mTLS, and TCP. \
 However, you do not have to set up all your gateways to use the same proxy. You can create multiple Envoy proxies in your cluster, as shown in [Example configuration for multiple gateway proxies]({{<ref "#example-configuration-for-multiple-gateway-proxies">}}).

* From the middle Gateway CRD to the left-hand VirtualService CRD in this diagram:  \
 You can configure the `Gateway` CR to select one or more `VirtualServices` by providing a discrete list of virtual services or by using Kubernetes labels. \
 Additionally, if you define a `Gateway` with the `ssl: true` setting, then you must choose the `VirtualServices` by configuring the `sslConfig` setting.


The following `Gateway` example selects a particular Envoy proxy, `public-gw`, and some `VirtualServices` with the Kubernetes label `gateway-type: public`.

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: public-gw-ssl
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: gloo
spec:
  bindAddress: "::"
  bindPort: 8443
  httpGateway:
    virtualServiceSelector:
      gateway-type: public # label set on the VirtualService
  useProxyProto: false
  ssl: true
  proxyNames:
  - public-gw # name of the Envoy proxy
```


## Example configuration for multiple gateway proxies

You can use the following Helm configuration file to create multiple proxies.
* `publicGw`: An internet-facing proxy, with the default HTTP `Gateway` disabled so that only secure HTTPS traffic is allowed from the public network.
* `corpGw`: A proxy for the company intranet, with the default HTTPS `Gateway` disabled so that traffic does not have to be encrypted because the network is private.

If you want additional `Gateways` for a single proxy, create your own `Gateway` _Custom Resources_, similar to what you can do with `VirtualServices`. For more information, see the [`Gateway` API reference documentation]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gateway/api/v1/gateway.proto.sk/" >}}).

As shown in the following example, you can declare as many Envoy proxies as you want under the `gloo.gatewayProxies` property in the Helm configuration file.

```yaml
gloo:
  gatewayProxies:
    publicGw: # Proxy name for public access (Internet facing)
      disabled: false # overwrite the "default" value in the merge step
      kind:
        deployment:
          replicas: 2
      service:
        httpPort: 80
        httpsFirst: true
        httpsPort: 443
        type: LoadBalancer
      tcpKeepaliveTimeSeconds: 5 # send keep-alive probes after 5s to keep connection up
      gatewaySettings:
        customHttpsGateway: # using the default HTTPS Gateway
          virtualServiceSelector:
            gateway-type: public # label set on the VirtualService
        disableHttpGateway: true # disable the default HTTP Gateway
    corpGw: # Proxy name for private access (intranet facing)
      disabled: false # overwrite the "default" value in the merge step
      service:
        httpPort: 80
        httpsFirst: false
        httpsPort: 443
        httpNodePort: 32080 # random port to be fixed in your private network
        type: NodePort
      tcpKeepaliveTimeSeconds: 5 # send keep-alive probes after 5s to keep connection up
      gatewaySettings:
        customHttpGateway: # using the default HTTP Gateway
          virtualServiceSelector:
            gateway-type: private # label set on the VirtualService
        disableHttpsGateway: true # disable the default HTTPS Gateway
    gatewayProxy:
      disabled: true # disable the default gateway-proxy deployment and its 2 default Gateway CRs
```


This will generate the following two `Gateway` CRs and also two Envoy deployments called `public-gw` and `private-gw`:

```bash {hl_lines=["4-5","17-18"]}
$ kubectl -n gloo-system get gw,deploy

```


The associated `VirtualServices` could be something like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: httpbin
  namespace: gloo-system
  labels:
    gateway-type: public # label used by the "public" Gateway
spec:
  sslConfig: # the internet-facing proxy uses TLS
    secretRef:
      name: upstream-tls
      namespace: gloo-system
  virtualHost:
    domains:
    - '*.mycompany.com' # listen on these public domain names
    routes:
    - matchers:
      - prefix: /
      routeAction:
        single:
          upstream:
            name: default-httpbin-8000
            namespace: gloo-system
---
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: httpbin-private
  namespace: gloo-system
  labels:
    gateway-type: private # label used by the "corp" Gateway
spec:
  virtualHost:
    domains:
    - '*.mycompany.corp' # listen on these private domain names
    routes:
    - matchers:
      - prefix: /
      routeAction:
        single:
          upstream:
            name: default-httpbin-8000
            namespace: gloo-system
```

You can check everything is correct with `glooctl` commands:

```bash
$ glooctl get vs

|                 |              |                  |            |          |                 | (upstream)                       |

## Custom Envoy Proxy Merge Behaviors

Declaring custom Envoy proxies can be configured with the following Helm configuration:

```yaml
gloo:
  gatewayProxies:
    gatewayProxy:
      gatewaySettings:
        customHttpsGateway:
          options:
            httpConnectionManagerSettings:
              maxConnectionDuration: 120s
              delayedCloseTimeout: 30s
              drainTimeout: 60s
    customGatewayProxy:
      gatewaySettings:
        customHttpsGateway:
          options:
            httpConnectionManagerSettings:
              maxConnectionDuration: 220s
              # Note: delayedCloseTimeout and drainTimeout intentionally omitted
```

The applied configuration of these deployed proxies is as follows:

1. gatewayProxy inherits the default values defined in the Helm chart, and then customizes then with values under `gatewayProxies.gatewayProxy`

2. customGatewayProxy inherits the default values defined in the Helm chart, then merges the custom values under `gatewayProxies.gatewayProxy` and then finally applies the values specific to itself, under `gatewayProxies.customGatewayProxy`.

The inheritance of values from the `gatewayProxy` cannot be customized per proxy, and thus, the `customGatewayProxy` in our example will have, values for `delayedCloseTimeout` and `drainTimeout`, even though they weren't specified. Given this behavior in the API, how can I safely configure multiple Envoy proxies? We explain the two options below.

### Option 1: You want your proxy configuration to be coupled to the default gatewayProxy

There is value in having a set of defaults that all proxies inherit from. If you want to follow this pattern, you neeed to be sure that your customGatewayProxy defines values it does not want to inherit. In our example, the Helm configuration would look like:

```yaml
gloo:
  gatewayProxies:
    gatewayProxy:
      gatewaySettings:
        customHttpsGateway:
          options:
            httpConnectionManagerSettings:
              maxConnectionDuration: 120s
              delayedCloseTimeout: 30s
              drainTimeout: 60s
    customGatewayProxy:
      gatewaySettings:
        customHttpsGateway:
          options:
            httpConnectionManagerSettings:
              # Explicitly set these values, to avoid inheriting from gatewayProxy
              maxConnectionDuration: 220s
              delayedCloseTimeout: 5s 
              drainTimeout: 1s     
```

### Option 2: You want your proxy configuration to be decoupled from the default gatewayProxy

There are situations where inheriting behaviors from the `gatewayProxy` implicitly causes unintended challenges, and there is value in having each Envoy proxy own its entire configuration. To achieve this, you must disable the `gatewayProxy` value, and only define custom proxies. Each of these are entirely decoupled, and will allow you to change one, without affecting the others.

```yaml
gloo:
  gatewayProxies:
    # disable the default gatewayProxy
    gatewayProxy:
      disabled: true 
    customGatewayProxy:
      gatewaySettings:
        customHttpsGateway:
          options:
            httpConnectionManagerSettings:
              maxConnectionDuration: 220s
              # Note: delayedCloseTimeout and drainTimeout intentionally omitted
              # and they will not be configured on the customGatewayProxy
```
