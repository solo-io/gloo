### VirtualHost

 
The top level element in the routing configuration is a virtual host. Each virtual host has
a logical name as well as a set of domains that get routed to it based on the incoming request's
host header. This allows a single listener to service multiple top level domain path trees. Once
a virtual host is selected based on the domain, the routes are processed in order to see which
upstream cluster to route to or whether to perform a redirect.

```yaml
"name": string
"domains": []string
"routes": []solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.Route
"requireTls": .solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.VirtualHost.TlsRequirementType

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `name` | `string` | The logical name of the virtual host. This is used when emitting certain statistics but is not relevant for routing. |
| `domains` | `[]string` | A list of domains (host/authority header) that will be matched to this virtual host. Wildcard hosts are supported in the suffix or prefix form. Domain search order: 1. Exact domain names: `www.foo.com`. 2. Suffix domain wildcards: `*.foo.com` or `*-bar.foo.com`. 3. Prefix domain wildcards: `foo.*` or `foo-*`. 4. Special wildcard `*` matching any domain. The wildcard will not match the empty string. e.g. `*-bar.foo.com` will match `baz-bar.foo.com` but not `-bar.foo.com`. The longest wildcards match first. Only a single virtual host in the entire route configuration can match on `*`. A domain must be unique across all virtual hosts or the config will fail to load. |
| `routes` | [[]solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.Route](../route.proto.sk/#route) | The list of routes that will be matched, in order, for incoming requests. The first route that matches will be used. |
| `requireTls` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.VirtualHost.TlsRequirementType](../route.proto.sk/#tlsrequirementtype) | Specifies the type of TLS enforcement the virtual host expects. If this option is not specified, there is no TLS requirement for the virtual host. |
| `virtualClusters` | [[]solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.VirtualCluster](../route.proto.sk/#virtualcluster) | A list of virtual clusters defined for this virtual host. Virtual clusters are used for additional statistics gathering. |
| `rateLimits` | [[]solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RateLimit](../route.proto.sk/#ratelimit) | Specifies a set of rate limit configurations that will be applied to the virtual host. |
| `requestHeadersToAdd` | [[]solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.HeaderValueOption](../../../../../github.com/solo-io/solo-kit/api/external/envoy/api/v2/core/base.proto.sk/#headervalueoption) | Specifies a list of HTTP headers that should be added to each request handled by this virtual host. Headers specified at this level are applied after headers from enclosed `envoy_api_msg_route.Route` and before headers from the enclosing `envoy_api_msg_RouteConfiguration`. For more information, including details on header value syntax, see the documentation on `custom request headers (config_http_conn_man_headers_custom_request_headers)`. |
| `requestHeadersToRemove` | `[]string` | Specifies a list of HTTP headers that should be removed from each request handled by this virtual host. |
| `responseHeadersToAdd` | [[]solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.HeaderValueOption](../../../../../github.com/solo-io/solo-kit/api/external/envoy/api/v2/core/base.proto.sk/#headervalueoption) | Specifies a list of HTTP headers that should be added to each response handled by this virtual host. Headers specified at this level are applied after headers from enclosed `envoy_api_msg_route.Route` and before headers from the enclosing `envoy_api_msg_RouteConfiguration`. For more information, including details on header value syntax, see the documentation on `custom request headers (config_http_conn_man_headers_custom_request_headers)`. |
| `responseHeadersToRemove` | `[]string` | Specifies a list of HTTP headers that should be removed from each response handled by this virtual host. |
| `cors` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.CorsPolicy](../route.proto.sk/#corspolicy) | Indicates that the virtual host has a CORS policy. |
| `perFilterConfig` | `map<string, .google.protobuf.Struct>` | The per_filter_config field can be used to provide virtual host-specific configurations for filters. The key should match the filter name, such as *envoy.filters.http.buffer* for the HTTP buffer filter. Use of this field is filter specific; see the `HTTP filter documentation (config_http_filters)` for if and how it is utilized. |
| `typedPerFilterConfig` | `map<string, .google.protobuf.Any>` | The per_filter_config field can be used to provide virtual host-specific configurations for filters. The key should match the filter name, such as *envoy.filters.http.buffer* for the HTTP buffer filter. Use of this field is filter specific; see the `HTTP filter documentation (config_http_filters)` for if and how it is utilized. |
| `includeRequestAttemptCount` | `bool` | Decides whether the `x-envoy-attempt-count (config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-attempt-count)` header should be included in the upstream request. Setting this option will cause it to override any existing header value, so in the case of two Envoys on the request path with this option enabled, the upstream will see the attempt count as perceived by the second Envoy. Defaults to false. This header is unaffected by the `suppress_envoy_headers (envoy_api_field_config.filter.http.router.v2.Router.suppress_envoy_headers)` flag. |
| `retryPolicy` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RetryPolicy](../route.proto.sk/#retrypolicy) | Indicates the retry policy for all routes in this virtual host. Note that setting a route level entry will take precedence over this config and it'll be treated independently (e.g.: values are not inherited). |
| `hedgePolicy` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.HedgePolicy](../route.proto.sk/#hedgepolicy) | Indicates the hedge policy for all routes in this virtual host. Note that setting a route level entry will take precedence over this config and it'll be treated independently (e.g.: values are not inherited). |




---
### TlsRequirementType



| Name | Description |
| ----- | ----------- | 
| `NONE` | No TLS requirement for the virtual host. |
| `EXTERNAL_ONLY` | External requests must use TLS. If a request is external and it is not using TLS, a 301 redirect will be sent telling the client to use HTTPS. |
| `ALL` | All requests must use TLS. If a request is not using TLS, a 301 redirect will be sent telling the client to use HTTPS. |




---
### Route

 
A route is both a specification of how to match a request as well as an indication of what to do
next (e.g., redirect, forward, rewrite, etc.).


  Envoy supports routing on HTTP method via `header matching
  (envoy_api_msg_route.HeaderMatcher)`.

```yaml
"name": string
"match": .solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RouteMatch
"route": .solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RouteAction
"redirect": .solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RedirectAction
"directResponse": .solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.DirectResponseAction
"metadata": .solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.Metadata
"decorator": .solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.Decorator
"perFilterConfig": map<string, .google.protobuf.Struct>
"typedPerFilterConfig": map<string, .google.protobuf.Any>
"requestHeadersToAdd": []solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.HeaderValueOption
"requestHeadersToRemove": []string
"responseHeadersToAdd": []solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.HeaderValueOption
"responseHeadersToRemove": []string
"tracing": .solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.Tracing

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `name` | `string` | Name for the route. |
| `match` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RouteMatch](../route.proto.sk/#routematch) | Route matching parameters. |
| `route` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RouteAction](../route.proto.sk/#routeaction) | Route request to some upstream cluster. Only one of `route`, `redirect`, or `directResponse` can be set. |
| `redirect` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RedirectAction](../route.proto.sk/#redirectaction) | Return a redirect. Only one of `redirect`, `route`, or `directResponse` can be set. |
| `directResponse` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.DirectResponseAction](../route.proto.sk/#directresponseaction) | Return an arbitrary HTTP response directly, without proxying. Only one of `directResponse`, `route`, or `redirect` can be set. |
| `metadata` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.Metadata](../../../../../github.com/solo-io/solo-kit/api/external/envoy/api/v2/core/base.proto.sk/#metadata) | The Metadata field can be used to provide additional information about the route. It can be used for configuration, stats, and logging. The metadata should go under the filter namespace that will need it. For instance, if the metadata is intended for the Router filter, the filter name should be specified as *envoy.filters.http.router*. |
| `decorator` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.Decorator](../route.proto.sk/#decorator) | Decorator for the matched route. |
| `perFilterConfig` | `map<string, .google.protobuf.Struct>` | The per_filter_config field can be used to provide route-specific configurations for filters. The key should match the filter name, such as *envoy.filters.http.buffer* for the HTTP buffer filter. Use of this field is filter specific; see the `HTTP filter documentation (config_http_filters)` for if and how it is utilized. |
| `typedPerFilterConfig` | `map<string, .google.protobuf.Any>` | The per_filter_config field can be used to provide route-specific configurations for filters. The key should match the filter name, such as *envoy.filters.http.buffer* for the HTTP buffer filter. Use of this field is filter specific; see the `HTTP filter documentation (config_http_filters)` for if and how it is utilized. |
| `requestHeadersToAdd` | [[]solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.HeaderValueOption](../../../../../github.com/solo-io/solo-kit/api/external/envoy/api/v2/core/base.proto.sk/#headervalueoption) | Specifies a set of headers that will be added to requests matching this route. Headers specified at this level are applied before headers from the enclosing `envoy_api_msg_route.VirtualHost` and `envoy_api_msg_RouteConfiguration`. For more information, including details on header value syntax, see the documentation on `custom request headers (config_http_conn_man_headers_custom_request_headers)`. |
| `requestHeadersToRemove` | `[]string` | Specifies a list of HTTP headers that should be removed from each request matching this route. |
| `responseHeadersToAdd` | [[]solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.HeaderValueOption](../../../../../github.com/solo-io/solo-kit/api/external/envoy/api/v2/core/base.proto.sk/#headervalueoption) | Specifies a set of headers that will be added to responses to requests matching this route.

---
### WeightedCluster

 
Compared to the `cluster (envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.cluster)` field that specifies a
single upstream cluster as the target of a request, the `weighted_clusters
(envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.weighted_clusters)` option allows for specification of
multiple upstream clusters along with weights that indicate the percentage of
traffic to be forwarded to each cluster. The router selects an upstream cluster based on the
weights.

```yaml
"clusters": []solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.WeightedCluster.ClusterWeight
"totalWeight": .google.protobuf.UInt32Value
"runtimeKeyPrefix": string

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `clusters` | [[]solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.WeightedCluster.ClusterWeight](../route.proto.sk/#clusterweight) | Specifies one or more upstream clusters associated with the route. |
| `totalWeight` | [.google.protobuf.UInt32Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/u-int-32-value) | Specifies the total weight across all clusters. The sum of all cluster weights must equal this value, which must be greater than 0. Defaults to 100. |
| `runtimeKeyPrefix` | `string` | Specifies the runtime key prefix that should be used to construct the runtime keys associated with each cluster. When the *runtime_key_prefix* is specified, the router will look for weights associated with each upstream cluster under the key *runtime_key_prefix* + "." + *cluster[i].name* where *cluster[i]* denotes an entry in the clusters array field. If the runtime key for the cluster does not exist, the value specified in the configuration file will be used as the default weight. See the `runtime documentation (operations_runtime)` for how key names map to the underlying implementation. |

### ClusterWeight



```yaml
"name": string
"weight": .google.protobuf.UInt32Value
"metadataMatch": .solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.Metadata
"requestHeadersToAdd": []solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.HeaderValueOption
"requestHeadersToRemove": []string
"responseHeadersToAdd": []solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.HeaderValueOption
"responseHeadersToRemove": []string
"perFilterConfig": map<string, .google.protobuf.Struct>
"typedPerFilterConfig": map<string, .google.protobuf.Any>

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `name` | `string` | Name of the upstream cluster. The cluster must exist in the `cluster manager configuration (config_cluster_manager)`. |
| `weight` | [.google.protobuf.UInt32Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/u-int-32-value) | An integer between 0 and `total_weight (envoy_api_field_route.WeightedCluster.total_weight)`. When a request matches the route, the choice of an upstream cluster is determined by its weight. The sum of weights across all entries in the clusters array must add up to the total_weight, which defaults to 100. |
| `metadataMatch` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.Metadata](../../../../../github.com/solo-io/solo-kit/api/external/envoy/api/v2/core/base.proto.sk/#metadata) | Optional endpoint metadata match criteria used by the subset load balancer. Only endpoints in the upstream cluster with metadata matching what is set in this field will be considered for load balancing. Note that this will be merged with what's provided in `RouteAction.MetadataMatch (envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.metadata_match)`, with values here taking precedence. The filter name should be specified as *envoy.lb*. |
| `requestHeadersToAdd` | [[]solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.HeaderValueOption](../../../../../github.com/solo-io/solo-kit/api/external/envoy/api/v2/core/base.proto.sk/#headervalueoption) | Specifies a list of headers to be added to requests when this cluster is selected through the enclosing `envoy_api_msg_route.RouteAction`. Headers specified at this level are applied before headers from the enclosing `envoy_api_msg_route.Route`, `envoy_api_msg_route.VirtualHost`, and `envoy_api_msg_RouteConfiguration`. For more information, including details on header value syntax, see the documentation on `custom request headers (config_http_conn_man_headers_custom_request_headers)`. |
| `requestHeadersToRemove` | `[]string` | Specifies a list of HTTP headers that should be removed from each request when this cluster is selected through the enclosing `envoy_api_msg_route.RouteAction`. |
| `responseHeadersToAdd` | [[]solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.HeaderValueOption](../../../../../github.com/solo-io/solo-kit/api/external/envoy/api/v2/core/base.proto.sk/#headervalueoption) | Specifies a list of headers to be added to responses when this cluster is selected through the enclosing `envoy_api_msg_route.RouteAction`. Headers specified at this level are applied before headers from the enclosing `envoy_api_msg_route.Route`, `envoy_api_msg_route.VirtualHost`, and `envoy_api_msg_RouteConfiguration`. For more information, including details on header value syntax, see the documentation on `custom request headers (config_http_conn_man_headers_custom_request_headers)`. |
| `responseHeadersToRemove` | `[]string` | Specifies a list of headers to be removed from responses when this cluster is selected through the enclosing `envoy_api_msg_route.RouteAction`. |
| `perFilterConfig` | `map<string, .google.protobuf.Struct>` | The per_filter_config field can be used to provide weighted cluster-specific configurations for filters. The key should match the filter name, such as *envoy.filters.http.buffer* for the HTTP buffer filter. Use of this field is filter specific; see the `HTTP filter documentation (config_http_filters)` for if and how it is utilized. |
| `typedPerFilterConfig` | `map<string, .google.protobuf.Any>` | The per_filter_config field can be used to provide weighted cluster-specific configurations for filters. The key should match the filter name, such as *envoy.filters.http.buffer* for the HTTP buffer filter. Use of this field is filter specific; see the `HTTP filter documentation (config_http_filters)` for if and how it is utilized. |

### RouteMatch



```yaml
"prefix": string
"path": string
"regex": string
"connectMatcher": .solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RouteMatch.ConnectMatcher
"caseSensitive": .google.protobuf.BoolValue
"runtimeFraction": .solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.RuntimeFractionalPercent
"headers": []solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.HeaderMatcher
"queryParameters": []solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.QueryParameterMatcher
"grpc": .solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RouteMatch.GrpcRouteMatchOptions

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `prefix` | `string` | If specified, the route is a prefix rule meaning that the prefix must match the beginning of the *:path* header. Only one of `prefix`, `path`, `regex`, or `connectMatcher` can be set. |
| `path` | `string` | If specified, the route is an exact path rule meaning that the path must exactly match the *:path* header once the query string is removed. Only one of `path`, `prefix`, `regex`, or `connectMatcher` can be set. |
| `regex` | `string` | If specified, the route is a regular expression rule meaning that the regex must match the *:path* header once the query string is removed. The entire path (without the query string) must match the regex. The rule will not match if only a subsequence of the *:path* header matches the regex. The regex grammar is defined [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/ecmascript). Examples: * The regex */b[io]t* matches the path */bit* * The regex */b[io]t* matches the path */bot* * The regex */b[io]t* does not match the path */bite* * The regex */b[io]t* does not match the path */bit/bot*. Only one of `regex`, `prefix`, `path`, or `connectMatcher` can be set. |
| `connectMatcher` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RouteMatch.ConnectMatcher](../route.proto.sk/#connectmatcher) | If this is used as the matcher, the matcher will only match CONNECT requests. Note that this will not match HTTP/2 upgrade-style CONNECT requests (WebSocket and the like) as they are normalized in Envoy as HTTP/1.1 style upgrades. This is the only way to match CONNECT requests for HTTP/1.1. For HTTP/2, where CONNECT requests may have a path, the path matchers will work if there is a path present. Note that CONNECT support is currently considered alpha in Envoy. Only one of `connectMatcher`, `prefix`, `path`, or `regex` can be set. |
| `caseSensitive` | [.google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value) | Indicates that prefix/path matching should be case insensitive. The default is true. |
| `runtimeFraction` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.RuntimeFractionalPercent](../../../../../github.com/solo-io/solo-kit/api/external/envoy/api/v2/core/base.proto.sk/#runtimefractionalpercent) | Indicates that the route should additionally match on a runtime key. Every time the route is considered for a match, it must also fall under the percentage of matches indicated by this field. For some fraction N/D, a random number in the range [0,D) is selected. If the number is <= the value of the numerator N, or if the key is not present, the default value, the router continues to evaluate the remaining match criteria. A runtime_fraction route configuration can be used to roll out route changes in a gradual manner without full code/config deploys. Refer to the `traffic shifting (config_http_conn_man_route_table_traffic_splitting_shift)` docs for additional documentation. Parsing this field is implemented such that the runtime key's data may be represented as a FractionalPercent proto represented as JSON/YAML and may also be represented as an integer with the assumption that the value is an integral percentage out of 100. For instance, a runtime key lookup returning the value "42" would parse as a FractionalPercent whose numerator is 42 and denominator is HUNDRED. This preserves legacy semantics. |
| `headers` | [[]solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.HeaderMatcher](../route.proto.sk/#headermatcher) | Specifies a set of headers that the route should match on. The router will check the request’s headers against all the specified headers in the route config. A match will happen if all the headers in the route are present in the request with the same values (or based on presence if the value field is not in the config). |
| `queryParameters` | [[]solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.QueryParameterMatcher](../route.proto.sk/#queryparametermatcher) | Specifies a set of URL query parameters on which the route should match. The router will check the query string from the *path* header against all the specified query parameters. If the number of specified query parameters is nonzero, they all must match the *path* header's query string for a match to occur. |
| `grpc` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RouteMatch.GrpcRouteMatchOptions](../route.proto.sk/#grpcroutematchoptions) | If specified, only gRPC requests will be matched. The router will check that the content-type header has a application/grpc or one of the various application/grpc+ values. |

Only one of `enabled` or `filterEnabled` can be set. |
| `filterEnabled` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.RuntimeFractionalPercent](../../../../../github.com/solo-io/solo-kit/api/external/envoy/api/v2/core/base.proto.sk/#runtimefractionalpercent) | Specifies if CORS is enabled. More information on how this can be controlled via runtime can be found `here (cors-runtime)`. This field defaults to 100/`HUNDRED (envoy_api_enum_type.FractionalPercent.DenominatorType)`.

| `cluster` | `string` | Indicates the upstream cluster to which the request should be routed to. Only one of `cluster`, `clusterHeader`, or `weightedClusters` can be set. |
| `clusterHeader` | `string` | Envoy will determine the cluster to route to by reading the value of the HTTP header named by cluster_header from the request headers. If the header is not found or the referenced cluster does not exist, Envoy will return a 404 response. Internally, Envoy always uses the HTTP/2 *:authority* header to represent the HTTP/1 *Host* header. Thus, if attempting to match on *Host*, match on *:authority* instead. Only one of `clusterHeader`, `cluster`, or `weightedClusters` can be set. |
| `weightedClusters` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.WeightedCluster](../route.proto.sk/#weightedcluster) | Multiple upstream clusters can be specified for a given route. The request is routed to one of the upstream clusters based on weights assigned to each cluster. See `traffic splitting (config_http_conn_man_route_table_traffic_splitting_split)` for additional documentation. Only one of `weightedClusters`, `cluster`, or `clusterHeader` can be set. |
| `clusterNotFoundResponseCode` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RouteAction.ClusterNotFoundResponseCode](../route.proto.sk/#clusternotfoundresponsecode) | The HTTP status code to use when configured cluster is not found. The default response code is 503 Service Unavailable. |
| `metadataMatch` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.Metadata](../../../../../github.com/solo-io/solo-kit/api/external/envoy/api/v2/core/base.proto.sk/#metadata) | Optional endpoint metadata match criteria used by the subset load balancer. Only endpoints in the upstream cluster with metadata matching what's set in this field will be considered for load balancing. If using `weighted_clusters (envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.weighted_clusters)`, metadata will be merged, with values provided there taking precedence. The filter name should be specified as *envoy.lb*. |
| `prefixRewrite` | `string` | Indicates that during forwarding, the matched prefix (or path) should be swapped with this value. This option allows application URLs to be rooted at a different path from those exposed at the reverse proxy layer. The router filter will place the original path before rewrite into the `x-envoy-original-path (config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-original-path)` header. Pay careful attention to the use of trailing slashes in the `route's match (envoy_api_field_route.Route.match)` prefix value. Stripping a prefix from a path requires multiple Routes to handle all cases. For example, rewriting */prefix* to */* and */prefix/etc* to */etc* cannot be done in a single `Route (envoy_api_msg_route.Route)`, as shown by the below config entries: ``` - match: prefix: "/prefix/" route: prefix_rewrite: "/" - match: prefix: "/prefix" route: prefix_rewrite: "/" ``` Having above entries in the config, requests to */prefix* will be stripped to */*, while requests to */prefix/etc* will be stripped to */etc*. |
| `hostRewrite` | `string` | Indicates that during forwarding, the host header will be swapped with this value. Only one of `hostRewrite`, `autoHostRewrite`, or `autoHostRewriteHeader` can be set. |
| `autoHostRewrite` | [.google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value) | Indicates that during forwarding, the host header will be swapped with the hostname of the upstream host chosen by the cluster manager. This option is applicable only when the destination cluster for a route is of type *strict_dns* or *logical_dns*. Setting this to true with other cluster types has no effect. Only one of `autoHostRewrite`, `hostRewrite`, or `autoHostRewriteHeader` can be set. |
| `autoHostRewriteHeader` | `string` | Indicates that during forwarding, the host header will be swapped with the content of given downstream or `custom (config_http_conn_man_headers_custom_request_headers)` header. If header value is empty, host header is left intact. Pay attention to the potential security implications of using this option. Provided header must come from trusted source. Only one of `autoHostRewriteHeader`, `hostRewrite`, or `autoHostRewrite` can be set. |
| `timeout` | [.google.protobuf.Duration](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/duration) | Specifies the upstream timeout for the route. If not specified, the default is 15s. This spans between the point at which the entire downstream request (i.e. end-of-stream) has been processed and when the upstream response has been completely processed. This timeout includes all retries. See also `config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-upstream-rq-timeout-ms`, `config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-upstream-rq-per-try-timeout-ms`, and the `retry overview (arch_overview_http_routing_retry)`. |
| `idleTimeout` | [.google.protobuf.Duration](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/duration) | Specifies the idle timeout for the route. If not specified, there is no per-route idle timeout, although the connection manager wide `stream_idle_timeout (envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.stream_idle_timeout)` will still apply. A value of 0 will completely disable the route's idle timeout, even if a connection manager stream idle timeout is configured. The idle timeout is distinct to `timeout (envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.timeout)`, which provides an upper bound on the upstream response time; `idle_timeout (envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.idle_timeout)` instead bounds the amount of time the request's stream may be idle. After header decoding, the idle timeout will apply on downstream and upstream request events. Each time an encode/decode event for headers or data is processed for the stream, the timer will be reset. If the timeout fires, the stream is terminated with a 408 Request Timeout error code if no upstream response header has been received, otherwise a stream reset occurs. |
| `retryPolicy` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RetryPolicy](../route.proto.sk/#retrypolicy) | Indicates that the route has a retry policy. Note that if this is set, it'll take precedence over the virtual host level retry policy entirely (e.g.: policies are not merged, most internal one becomes the enforced policy). |
| `requestMirrorPolicy` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RouteAction.RequestMirrorPolicy](../route.proto.sk/#requestmirrorpolicy) | Indicates that the route has a request mirroring policy. |
| `priority` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.RoutingPriority](../../../../../github.com/solo-io/solo-kit/api/external/envoy/api/v2/core/base.proto.sk/#routingpriority) | Optionally specifies the `routing priority (arch_overview_http_routing_priority)`. https://github.com/lyft/protoc-gen-validate/issues/42 is resolved.]. |
| `rateLimits` | [[]solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RateLimit](../route.proto.sk/#ratelimit) | Specifies a set of rate limit configurations that could be applied to the route. |
| `includeVhRateLimits` | [.google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value) | Specifies if the rate limit filter should include the virtual host rate limits. By default, if the route configured rate limits, the virtual host `rate_limits (envoy_api_field_route.VirtualHost.rate_limits)` are not applied to the request. |
| `hashPolicy` | [[]solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RouteAction.HashPolicy](../route.proto.sk/#hashpolicy) | Specifies a list of hash policies to use for ring hash load balancing. Each hash policy is evaluated individually and the combined result is used to route the request. The method of combination is deterministic such that identical lists of hash policies will produce the same hash. Since a hash policy examines specific parts of a request, it can fail to produce a hash (i.e. if the hashed header is not present). If (and only if) all configured hash policies fail to generate a hash, no hash will be produced for the route. In this case, the behavior is the same as if no hash policies were specified (i.e. the ring hash load balancer will choose a random backend). If a hash policy has the "terminal" attribute set to true, and there is already a hash generated, the hash is returned immediately, ignoring the rest of the hash policy list. |
| `cors` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.CorsPolicy](../route.proto.sk/#corspolicy) | Indicates that the route has a CORS policy. |
| `maxGrpcTimeout` | [.google.protobuf.Duration](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/duration) | If present, and the request is a gRPC request, use the [grpc-timeout header](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md), or its default value (infinity) instead of `timeout (envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.timeout)`, but limit the applied timeout to the maximum value specified here. If configured as 0, the maximum allowed timeout for gRPC requests is infinity. If not configured at all, the `grpc-timeout` header is not used and gRPC requests time out like any other requests using `timeout (envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.timeout)` or its default. This can be used to prevent unexpected upstream request timeouts due to potentially long time gaps between gRPC request and response in gRPC streaming mode. |
| `grpcTimeoutOffset` | [.google.protobuf.Duration](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/duration) | If present, Envoy will adjust the timeout provided by the `grpc-timeout` header by subtracting the provided duration from the header. This is useful in allowing Envoy to set its global timeout to be less than that of the deadline imposed by the calling client, which makes it more likely that Envoy will handle the timeout instead of having the call canceled by the client. The offset will only be applied if the provided grpc_timeout is greater than the offset. This ensures that the offset will only ever decrease the timeout and never set it to 0 (meaning infinity). |
| `upgradeConfigs` | [[]solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RouteAction.UpgradeConfig](../route.proto.sk/#upgradeconfig) |  |
| `internalRedirectAction` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RouteAction.InternalRedirectAction](../route.proto.sk/#internalredirectaction) |  |
| `hedgePolicy` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.HedgePolicy](../route.proto.sk/#hedgepolicy) | Indicates that the route has a hedge policy. Note that if this is set, it'll take precedence over the virtual host level hedge policy entirely (e.g.: policies are not merged, most internal one becomes the enforced policy). |




---
### RequestMirrorPolicy

 
The router is capable of shadowing traffic from one cluster to another. The current
implementation is "fire and forget," meaning Envoy will not wait for the shadow cluster to
respond before returning the response from the primary cluster. All normal statistics are
collected for the shadow cluster making this feature useful for testing.

During shadowing, the host/authority header is altered such that *-shadow* is appended. This is
useful for logging. For example, *cluster1* becomes *cluster1-shadow*.

```yaml
"cluster": string
"runtimeKey": string
"runtimeFraction": .solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.RuntimeFractionalPercent

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `cluster` | `string` | Specifies the cluster that requests will be mirrored to. The cluster must exist in the cluster manager configuration. |
| `runtimeKey` | `string` | If not specified, all requests to the target cluster will be mirrored. If specified, Envoy will lookup the runtime key to get the % of requests to mirror. Valid values are from 0 to 10000, allowing for increments of 0.01% of requests to be mirrored. If the runtime key is specified in the configuration but not present in runtime, 0 is the default and thus 0% of requests will be mirrored. **This field is deprecated**. Set the `runtime_fraction (envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.RequestMirrorPolicy.runtime_fraction)` field instead. |
| `runtimeFraction` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.RuntimeFractionalPercent](../../../../../github.com/solo-io/solo-kit/api/external/envoy/api/v2/core/base.proto.sk/#runtimefractionalpercent) | If both `runtime_key (envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.RequestMirrorPolicy.runtime_key)` and this field are not specified, all requests to the target cluster will be mirrored. If specified, this field takes precedence over the `runtime_key` field and requests must also fall under the percentage of matches indicated by this field. For some fraction N/D, a random number in the range [0,D) is selected. If the number is <= the value of the numerator N, or if the key is not present, the default value, the request will be mirrored. Parsing this field is implemented such that the runtime key's data may be represented as a `FractionalPercent (envoy_api_msg_type.FractionalPercent)` proto represented as JSON/YAML and may also be represented as an integer with the assumption that the value is an integral percentage out of 100. For instance, a runtime key lookup returning the value "42" would parse as a `FractionalPercent` whose numerator is 42 and denominator is HUNDRED. This is behaviour is different to that of the deprecated `runtime_key` field, where the implicit denominator is 10000. |




---
### HashPolicy

 
Specifies the route's hashing policy if the upstream cluster uses a hashing `load balancer
(arch_overview_load_balancing_types)`.

```yaml
"header": .solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RouteAction.HashPolicy.Header
"cookie": .solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RouteAction.HashPolicy.Cookie
"connectionProperties": .solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RouteAction.HashPolicy.ConnectionProperties
"terminal": bool

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `header` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RouteAction.HashPolicy.Header](../route.proto.sk/#header) | Header hash policy. Only one of `header`, `cookie`, or `connectionProperties` can be set. |
| `cookie` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RouteAction.HashPolicy.Cookie](../route.proto.sk/#cookie) | Cookie hash policy. Only one of `cookie`, `header`, or `connectionProperties` can be set. |
| `connectionProperties` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RouteAction.HashPolicy.ConnectionProperties](../route.proto.sk/#connectionproperties) | Connection properties hash policy. Only one of `connectionProperties`, `header`, or `cookie` can be set. |
| `terminal` | `bool` | The flag that shortcircuits the hash computing. This field provides a 'fallback' style of configuration: "if a terminal policy doesn't work, fallback to rest of the policy list", it saves time when the terminal policy works. If true, and there is already a hash computed, ignore rest of the list of hash polices. For example, if the following hash methods are configured: ========= ======== specifier terminal ========= ======== Header A true Header B false Header C false ========= ======== The generateHash process ends if policy "header A" generates a hash, as it's a terminal policy. |




---
### Header



```yaml
"headerName": string

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `headerName` | `string` | The name of the request header that will be used to obtain the hash key. If the request header is not present, no hash will be produced. |




---
### Cookie

 
Envoy supports two types of cookie affinity:

1. Passive. Envoy takes a cookie that's present in the cookies header and
   hashes on its value.

2. Generated. Envoy generates and sets a cookie with an expiration (TTL)
   on the first request from the client in its response to the client,
   based on the endpoint the request gets sent to. The client then
   presents this on the next and all subsequent requests. The hash of
   this is sufficient to ensure these requests get sent to the same
   endpoint. The cookie is generated by hashing the source and
   destination ports and addresses so that multiple independent HTTP2
   streams on the same connection will independently receive the same
   cookie, even if they arrive at the Envoy simultaneously.

```yaml
"name": string
"ttl": .google.protobuf.Duration
"path": string

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `name` | `string` | The name of the cookie that will be used to obtain the hash key. If the cookie is not present and ttl below is not set, no hash will be produced. |
| `ttl` | [.google.protobuf.Duration](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/duration) | If specified, a cookie with the TTL will be generated if the cookie is not present. If the TTL is present and zero, the generated cookie will be a session cookie. |
| `path` | `string` | The name of the path for the cookie. If no path is specified here, no path will be set for the cookie. |




---
### ConnectionProperties



```yaml
"sourceIp": bool

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `sourceIp` | `bool` | Hash on source IP address. |




---
### UpgradeConfig

 
Allows enabling and disabling upgrades on a per-route basis.
This overrides any enabled/disabled upgrade filter chain specified in the
HttpConnectionManager
`upgrade_configs
(envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.upgrade_configs)`
but does not affect any custom filter chain specified there.

```yaml
"upgradeType": string
"enabled": .google.protobuf.BoolValue

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `upgradeType` | `string` | The case-insensitive name of this upgrade, e.g. "websocket". For each upgrade type present in upgrade_configs, requests with Upgrade: [upgrade_type] will be proxied upstream. |
| `enabled` | [.google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value) | Determines if upgrades are available on this route. Defaults to true. |




---
### ClusterNotFoundResponseCode



| Name | Description |
| ----- | ----------- | 
| `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | HTTP status code - 503 Service Unavailable. |
| `NOT_FOUND` | HTTP status code - 404 Not Found. |




---
### InternalRedirectAction

 
Configures `internal redirect (arch_overview_internal_redirects)` behavior.

| Name | Description |
| ----- | ----------- | 
| `PASS_THROUGH_INTERNAL_REDIRECT` |  |
| `HANDLE_INTERNAL_REDIRECT` |  |




---
### RetryPolicy

 
HTTP retry `architecture overview (arch_overview_http_routing_retry)`.

```yaml
"retryOn": string
"numRetries": .google.protobuf.UInt32Value
"perTryTimeout": .google.protobuf.Duration
"retryPriority": .solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RetryPolicy.RetryPriority
"retryHostPredicate": []solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RetryPolicy.RetryHostPredicate
"hostSelectionRetryMaxAttempts": int
"retriableStatusCodes": []int
"retryBackOff": .solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RetryPolicy.RetryBackOff

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `retryOn` | `string` | Specifies the conditions under which retry takes place. These are the same conditions documented for `config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-retry-on` and `config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-retry-grpc-on`. |
| `numRetries` | [.google.protobuf.UInt32Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/u-int-32-value) | Specifies the allowed number of retries. This parameter is optional and defaults to 1. These are the same conditions documented for `config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-max-retries`. |
| `perTryTimeout` | [.google.protobuf.Duration](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/duration) | Specifies a non-zero upstream timeout per retry attempt. This parameter is optional. The same conditions documented for `config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-upstream-rq-per-try-timeout-ms` apply. If left unspecified, Envoy will use the global `route timeout (envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.timeout)` for the request. Consequently, when using a `5xx (config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-retry-on)` based retry policy, a request that times out will not be retried as the total timeout budget would have been exhausted. |
| `retryPriority` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RetryPolicy.RetryPriority](../route.proto.sk/#retrypriority) | Specifies an implementation of a RetryPriority which is used to determine the distribution of load across priorities used for retries. Refer to `retry plugin configuration (arch_overview_http_retry_plugins)` for more details. |
| `retryHostPredicate` | [[]solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RetryPolicy.RetryHostPredicate](../route.proto.sk/#retryhostpredicate) | Specifies a collection of RetryHostPredicates that will be consulted when selecting a host for retries. If any of the predicates reject the host, host selection will be reattempted. Refer to `retry plugin configuration (arch_overview_http_retry_plugins)` for more details. |
| `hostSelectionRetryMaxAttempts` | `int` | The maximum number of times host selection will be reattempted before giving up, at which point the host that was last selected will be routed to. If unspecified, this will default to retrying once. |
| `retriableStatusCodes` | `[]int` | HTTP status codes that should trigger a retry in addition to those specified by retry_on. |
| `retryBackOff` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RetryPolicy.RetryBackOff](../route.proto.sk/#retrybackoff) | Specifies parameters that control retry back off. This parameter is optional, in which case the default base interval is 25 milliseconds or, if set, the current value of the `upstream.base_retry_backoff_ms` runtime parameter. The default maximum interval is 10 times the base interval. The documentation for `config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-max-retries` describes Envoy's back-off algorithm. |

| `typedConfig` | [.google.protobuf.Any](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/any) |  Only one of `typedConfig` or `config` can be set. |




---
### RetryBackOff



```yaml
"baseInterval": .google.protobuf.Duration
"maxInterval": .google.protobuf.Duration

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `baseInterval` | [.google.protobuf.Duration](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/duration) | Specifies the base interval between retries. This parameter is required and must be greater than zero. Values less than 1 ms are rounded up to 1 ms. See `config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-max-retries` for a discussion of Envoy's back-off algorithm. |
| `maxInterval` | [.google.protobuf.Duration](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/duration) | Specifies the maximum interval between retries. This parameter is optional, but must be greater than or equal to the `base_interval` if set. The default is 10 times the `base_interval`. See `config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-max-retries` for a discussion of Envoy's back-off algorithm. |

### HedgePolicy

 
HTTP request hedging `architecture overview (arch_overview_http_routing_hedging)`.

```yaml
"initialRequests": .google.protobuf.UInt32Value
"additionalRequestChance": .solo.io.envoy.type.FractionalPercent
"hedgeOnPerTryTimeout": bool

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `initialRequests` | [.google.protobuf.UInt32Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/u-int-32-value) | Specifies the number of initial requests that should be sent upstream. Must be at least 1. Defaults to 1. [#not-implemented-hide:]. |
| `additionalRequestChance` | [.solo.io.envoy.type.FractionalPercent](../../../../../github.com/solo-io/solo-kit/api/external/envoy/type/percent.proto.sk/#fractionalpercent) | Specifies a probability that an additional upstream request should be sent on top of what is specified by initial_requests. Defaults to 0. [#not-implemented-hide:]. |
| `hedgeOnPerTryTimeout` | `bool` | Indicates that a hedged request should be sent when the per-try timeout is hit. This will only occur if the retry policy also indicates that a timed out request should be retried. Once a timed out request is retried due to per try timeout, the router filter will ensure that it is not retried again even if the returned response headers would otherwise be retried according the specified `RetryPolicy (envoy_api_msg_route.RetryPolicy)`. Defaults to false. |

| `schemeRedirect` | `string` | The scheme portion of the URL will be swapped with this value. Only one of `schemeRedirect` or `httpsRedirect` can be set. |
| `hostRedirect` | `string` | The host portion of the URL will be swapped with this value. |
| `portRedirect` | `int` | The port value of the URL will be swapped with this value. |
| `pathRedirect` | `string` | The path portion of the URL will be swapped with this value. Only one of `pathRedirect` or `prefixRewrite` can be set. |
| `prefixRewrite` | `string` | Indicates that during redirection, the matched prefix (or path) should be swapped with this value. This option allows redirect URLs be dynamically created based on the request. Pay attention to the use of trailing slashes as mentioned in `RouteAction's prefix_rewrite (envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.prefix_rewrite)`. Only one of `prefixRewrite` or `pathRedirect` can be set. |
| `responseCode` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RedirectAction.RedirectResponseCode](../route.proto.sk/#redirectresponsecode) | The HTTP status code to use in the redirect response. The default response code is MOVED_PERMANENTLY (301). |
| `stripQuery` | `bool` | Indicates that during redirection, the query portion of the URL will be removed. Default value is false. |

If this setting is omitted, no body is included in the generated response. Headers can be specified using *response_headers_to_add* in the enclosing `envoy_api_msg_route.Route`, `envoy_api_msg_RouteConfiguration` or `envoy_api_msg_route.VirtualHost`. |




---
### Decorator



```yaml
"operation": string

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `operation` | `string` | The operation name associated with the request matched to this route. If tracing is enabled, this information will be used as the span name reported for this request.

### VirtualCluster

 
A virtual cluster is a way of specifying a regex matching rule against
certain important endpoints such that statistics are generated explicitly for
the matched requests. The reason this is useful is that when doing
prefix/path matching Envoy does not always know what the application
considers to be an endpoint. Thus, it’s impossible for Envoy to generically
emit per endpoint statistics. However, often systems have highly critical
endpoints that they wish to get “perfect” statistics on. Virtual cluster
statistics are perfect in the sense that they are emitted on the downstream
side such that they include network level failures.

Documentation for `virtual cluster statistics (config_http_filters_router_stats)`.


   Virtual clusters are a useful tool, but we do not recommend setting up a virtual cluster for
   every application endpoint. This is both not easily maintainable and as well the matching and
   statistics output are not free.

```yaml
"pattern": string
"name": string
"method": .solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.RequestMethod

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `pattern` | `string` | Specifies a regex pattern to use for matching requests. The entire path of the request must match the regex. The regex grammar used is defined [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/ecmascript). Examples: * The regex */rides/\d+* matches the path */rides/0* * The regex */rides/\d+* matches the path */rides/123* * The regex */rides/\d+* does not match the path */rides/123/456*. |
| `name` | `string` | Specifies the name of the virtual cluster. The virtual cluster name as well as the virtual host name are used when emitting statistics. The statistics are emitted by the router filter and are documented `here (config_http_filters_router_stats)`. |
| `method` | [.solo.io.envoy.api.v2.core.RequestMethod](../../../../../github.com/solo-io/solo-kit/api/external/envoy/api/v2/core/base.proto.sk/#requestmethod) | Optionally specifies the HTTP method to match on. For example GET, PUT, etc. https://github.com/lyft/protoc-gen-validate/issues/42 is resolved.]. |

"disableKey": string
"actions": []solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RateLimit.Action

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `stage` | [.google.protobuf.UInt32Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/u-int-32-value) | Refers to the stage set in the filter. The rate limit configuration only applies to filters with the same stage number. The default stage number is 0. The filter supports a range of 0 - 10 inclusively for stage numbers. |
| `disableKey` | `string` | The key to be set in runtime to disable this rate limit configuration. |
| `actions` | [[]solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.RateLimit.Action](../route.proto.sk/#action) | A list of actions that are to be applied for this rate limit configuration. Order matters as the actions are processed sequentially and the descriptor is composed by appending descriptor entries in that sequence. If an action cannot append a descriptor entry, no descriptor is generated for the configuration. See `composing actions (config_http_filters_rate_limit_composing_actions)` for additional documentation. |

### SourceCluster

 
The following descriptor entry is appended to the descriptor:

```
  ("source_cluster", "<local service cluster>")
```

<local service cluster> is derived from the `--service-cluster` option.

```yaml

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 




---
### DestinationCluster

 
The following descriptor entry is appended to the descriptor:

```
  ("destination_cluster", "<routed target cluster>")
```

Once a request matches against a route table rule, a routed cluster is determined by one of
the following `route table configuration (envoy_api_msg_RouteConfiguration)`
settings:

* `cluster (envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.cluster)` indicates the upstream cluster
  to route to.
* `weighted_clusters (envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.weighted_clusters)`
  chooses a cluster randomly from a set of clusters with attributed weight.
* `cluster_header (envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.cluster_header)` indicates which
  header in the request contains the target cluster.

```yaml

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 




---
### RequestHeaders

 
The following descriptor entry is appended when a header contains a key that matches the
*header_name*:

```
  ("<descriptor_key>", "<header_value_queried_from_header>")
```

```yaml
"headerName": string
"descriptorKey": string

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `headerName` | `string` | The header name to be queried from the request headers. The header’s value is used to populate the value of the descriptor entry for the descriptor_key. |
| `descriptorKey` | `string` | The key to use in the descriptor entry. |




---
### RemoteAddress

 
The following descriptor entry is appended to the descriptor and is populated using the
trusted address from `x-forwarded-for (config_http_conn_man_headers_x-forwarded-for)`:

```
  ("remote_address", "<trusted address from x-forwarded-for>")
```

```yaml

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 




---
### GenericKey

 
The following descriptor entry is appended to the descriptor:

```
  ("generic_key", "<descriptor_value>")
```

```yaml
"descriptorValue": string

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `descriptorValue` | `string` | The value to use in the descriptor entry. |




---
### HeaderValueMatch

 
The following descriptor entry is appended to the descriptor:

```
  ("header_match", "<descriptor_value>")
```

```yaml
"descriptorValue": string
"expectMatch": .google.protobuf.BoolValue
"headers": []solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.HeaderMatcher

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `descriptorValue` | `string` | The value to use in the descriptor entry. |
| `expectMatch` | [.google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value) | If set to true, the action will append a descriptor entry when the request matches the headers. If set to false, the action will append a descriptor entry when the request does not match the headers. The default value is true. |
| `headers` | [[]solo.io.envoy.api.v2.route.HeaderMatcher](../route.proto.sk/#headermatcher) | Specifies a set of headers that the rate limit action should match on. The action will check the request’s headers against all the specified headers in the config. A match will happen if all the headers in the config are present in the request with the same values (or based on presence if the value field is not in the config). |




---
### HeaderMatcher

 
Internally, Envoy always uses the HTTP/2 *:authority* header to represent the HTTP/1 *Host*
  header. Thus, if attempting to match on *Host*, match on *:authority* instead.


  To route on HTTP method, use the special HTTP/2 *:method* header. This works for both
  HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 as Envoy normalizes headers. E.g.,

  ```
    {
      "name": ":method",
      "exact_match": "POST"
    }
  ```

  In the absence of any header match specifier, match will default to `present_match
  (envoy_api_field_route.HeaderMatcher.present_match)`. i.e, a request that has the `name
  (envoy_api_field_route.HeaderMatcher.name)` header will match, regardless of the header's
  value.

```yaml
"name": string
"exactMatch": string
"regexMatch": string
"rangeMatch": .solo.io.envoy.type.Int64Range
"presentMatch": bool
"prefixMatch": string
"suffixMatch": string
"invertMatch": bool

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `name` | `string` | Specifies the name of the header in the request. |
| `exactMatch` | `string` | If specified, header match will be performed based on the value of the header. Only one of `exactMatch`, `regexMatch`, `rangeMatch`, `presentMatch`, `prefixMatch`, or `suffixMatch` can be set. |
| `regexMatch` | `string` | If specified, this regex string is a regular expression rule which implies the entire request header value must match the regex. The rule will not match if only a subsequence of the request header value matches the regex. The regex grammar used in the value field is defined [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/ecmascript). Examples: * The regex *\d{3}* matches the value *123* * The regex *\d{3}* does not match the value *1234* * The regex *\d{3}* does not match the value *123.456*. Only one of `regexMatch`, `exactMatch`, `rangeMatch`, `presentMatch`, `prefixMatch`, or `suffixMatch` can be set. |
| `rangeMatch` | .solo.io.envoy.type.Int64Range | If specified, header match will be performed based on range. The rule will match if the request header value is within this range. The entire request header value must represent an integer in base 10 notation: consisting of an optional plus or minus sign followed by a sequence of digits. The rule will not match if the header value does not represent an integer. Match will fail for empty values, floating point numbers or if only a subsequence of the header value is an integer. Examples: * For range [-10,0), route will match for header value -1, but not for 0, "somestring", 10.9, "-1somestring". Only one of `rangeMatch`, `exactMatch`, `regexMatch`, `presentMatch`, `prefixMatch`, or `suffixMatch` can be set. |
| `presentMatch` | `bool` | If specified, header match will be performed based on whether the header is in the request. Only one of `presentMatch`, `exactMatch`, `regexMatch`, `rangeMatch`, `prefixMatch`, or `suffixMatch` can be set. |
| `prefixMatch` | `string` | If specified, header match will be performed based on the prefix of the header value. Note: empty prefix is not allowed, please use present_match instead. Examples: * The prefix *abcd* matches the value *abcdxyz*, but not for *abcxyz*. Only one of `prefixMatch`, `exactMatch`, `regexMatch`, `rangeMatch`, `presentMatch`, or `suffixMatch` can be set. |
| `suffixMatch` | `string` | If specified, header match will be performed based on the suffix of the header value. Note: empty suffix is not allowed, please use present_match instead. Examples: * The suffix *abcd* matches the value *xyzabcd*, but not for *xyzbcd*. Only one of `suffixMatch`, `exactMatch`, `regexMatch`, `rangeMatch`, `presentMatch`, or `prefixMatch` can be set. |
| `invertMatch` | `bool` | If specified, the match result will be inverted before checking. Defaults to false. Examples: * The regex *\d{3}* does not match the value *1234*, so it will match when inverted. * The range [-10,0) will match the value -1, so it will not match when inverted. |

### QueryParameterMatcher

 
Query parameter matching treats the query string of a request's :path header
as an ampersand-separated list of keys and/or key=value elements.

```yaml
"name": string
"value": string
"regex": .google.protobuf.BoolValue

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `name` | `string` | Specifies the name of a key that must be present in the requested *path*'s query string. |
| `value` | `string` | Specifies the value of the key. If the value is absent, a request that contains the key in its query string will match, whether the key appears with a value (e.g., "?debug=true") or not (e.g., "?debug"). |
| `regex` | [.google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value) | Specifies whether the query parameter value is a regular expression. Defaults to false. The entire query parameter value (i.e., the part to the right of the equals sign in "key=value") must match the regex. E.g., the regex "\d+$" will match "123" but not "a123" or "123a". |
