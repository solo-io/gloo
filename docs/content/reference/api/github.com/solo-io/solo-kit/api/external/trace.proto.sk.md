### Span

 
A span represents a single operation within a trace. Spans can be
nested to form a trace tree. Often, a trace contains a root span
that describes the end-to-end latency, and one or more subspans for
its sub-operations. A trace can also contain multiple root spans,
or none at all. Spans do not need to be contiguous - there may be
gaps or overlaps between spans in a trace.

The next id is 15.
TODO(bdrutu): Add an example.

```yaml
"traceId": bytes
"spanId": bytes
"parentSpanId": bytes
"name": .opencensus.proto.trace.TruncatableString
"kind": .opencensus.proto.trace.Span.SpanKind
"startTime": .google.protobuf.Timestamp
"endTime": .google.protobuf.Timestamp

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `traceId` | `bytes` | A unique identifier for a trace. All spans from the same trace share the same `trace_id`. The ID is a 16-byte array. This field is required. |
| `spanId` | `bytes` | A unique identifier for a span within a trace, assigned when the span is created. The ID is an 8-byte array. This field is required. |
| `parentSpanId` | `bytes` | The `span_id` of this span's parent span. If this is a root span, then this field must be empty. The ID is an 8-byte array. |
| `name` | [.opencensus.proto.trace.TruncatableString](../trace.proto.sk/#truncatablestring) | A description of the span's operation. For example, the name can be a qualified method name or a file name and a line number where the operation is called. A best practice is to use the same display name at the same call point in an application. This makes it easier to correlate spans in different traces. This field is required. |
| `kind` | [.opencensus.proto.trace.Span.SpanKind](../trace.proto.sk/#spankind) | Distinguishes between spans generated in a particular context. For example, two spans with the same name may be distinguished using `CLIENT` and `SERVER` to identify queueing latency associated with the span. |
| `startTime` | [.google.protobuf.Timestamp](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/timestamp) | The start time of the span. On the client side, this is the time kept by the local machine where the span execution starts. On the server side, this is the time when the server's application handler starts running. |
| `endTime` | [.google.protobuf.Timestamp](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/timestamp) | The end time of the span. On the client side, this is the time kept by the local machine where the span execution ends. On the server side, this is the time when the server application handler stops running. |
| `attributes` | [.opencensus.proto.trace.Span.Attributes](../trace.proto.sk/#attributes) | A set of attributes on the span. |
| `stackTrace` | [.opencensus.proto.trace.StackTrace](../trace.proto.sk/#stacktrace) | A stack trace captured at the start of the span. |
| `timeEvents` | [.opencensus.proto.trace.Span.TimeEvents](../trace.proto.sk/#timeevents) | The included time events. |
| `links` | [.opencensus.proto.trace.Span.Links](../trace.proto.sk/#links) | The inclued links. |
| `status` | [.opencensus.proto.trace.Status](../trace.proto.sk/#status) | An optional final status for this span. |
| `sameProcessAsParentSpan` | [.google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value) | A highly recommended but not required flag that identifies when a trace crosses a process boundary. True when the parent_span belongs to the same process as the current span. |
| `childSpanCount` | [.google.protobuf.UInt32Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/u-int-32-value) | An optional number of child spans that were generated while this span was active. If set, allows an implementation to detect missing child spans. |

| `attributeMap` | `map<string, .opencensus.proto.trace.AttributeValue>` | The set of attributes. The value can be a string, an integer, or the Boolean values `true` and `false`. For example: "/instance_id": "my-instance" "/http/user_agent": "" "/http/server_latency": 300 "abc.com/myattribute": true. |
| `droppedAttributesCount` | `int` | The number of attributes that were discarded. Attributes can be discarded because their keys are too long or because there are too many attributes. If this value is 0, then no attributes were dropped. |

### Status

 
The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different
programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. This proto's fields
are a subset of those of
[google.rpc.Status](https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/rpc/status.proto),
which is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc).

| `stackTraceHashId` | `int` | The hash ID is used to conserve network bandwidth for duplicate stack traces within a single trace. Often multiple spans will have identical stack traces. The first occurrence of a stack trace should contain both `stack_frames` and a value in `stack_trace_hash_id`. Subsequent spans within the same request can refer to that stack trace by setting only `stack_trace_hash_id`. TODO: describe how to deal with the case where stack_trace_hash_id is zero because it was not set. |




---
### StackFrame

 
A single stack frame in a stack trace.

| `fileName` | [.opencensus.proto.trace.TruncatableString](../trace.proto.sk/#truncatablestring) | The name of the source file where the function call appears. |
| `lineNumber` | `int` | The line number in `file_name` where the function call appears. |
| `columnNumber` | `int` | The column number where the function call appears, if available. This is important in JavaScript because of its anonymous functions. |
| `loadModule` | [.opencensus.proto.trace.Module](../trace.proto.sk/#module) | The binary module from where the code was loaded. |
| `sourceVersion` | [.opencensus.proto.trace.TruncatableString](../trace.proto.sk/#truncatablestring) | The version of the deployed source code. |

"buildId": .opencensus.proto.trace.TruncatableString

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `module` | [.opencensus.proto.trace.TruncatableString](../trace.proto.sk/#truncatablestring) | TODO: document the meaning of this field. For example: main binary, kernel modules, and dynamic libraries such as libc.so, sharedlib.so. |
| `buildId` | [.opencensus.proto.trace.TruncatableString](../trace.proto.sk/#truncatablestring) | A unique identifier for the module, usually a hash of its contents. |




---
### TruncatableString

 
A string that might be shortened to a specified length.

```yaml
"value": string
"truncatedByteCount": int

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `value` | `string` | The shortened string. For example, if the original string was 500 bytes long and the limit of the string was 128 bytes, then this value contains the first 128 bytes of the 500-byte string. Note that truncation always happens on a character boundary, to ensure that a truncated string is still valid UTF-8. Because it may contain multi-byte characters, the size of the truncated string may be less than the truncation limit. |
| `truncatedByteCount` | `int` | The number of bytes removed from the original string. If this value is 0, then the string was not shortened. |
