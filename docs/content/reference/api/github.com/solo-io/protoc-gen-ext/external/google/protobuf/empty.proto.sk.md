### Empty

 
A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
or the response type of an API method. For instance:

    service Foo {
      rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
    }

The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.

```yaml

```
