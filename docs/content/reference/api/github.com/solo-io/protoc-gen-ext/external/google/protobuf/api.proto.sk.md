### Api

 
Api is a light-weight descriptor for an API Interface.

Interfaces are also described as "protocol buffer services" in some contexts,
such as by the "service" keyword in a .proto file, but they are different
from API Services, which represent a concrete implementation of an interface
as opposed to simply a description of methods and bindings. They are also
sometimes simply referred to as "APIs" in other contexts, such as the name of
this message itself. See https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/glossary for
detailed terminology.

```yaml
"name": string
"methods": []google.protobuf.Method
"options": []google.protobuf.Option
"version": string
"sourceContext": .google.protobuf.SourceContext
"mixins": []google.protobuf.Mixin
"syntax": .google.protobuf.Syntax

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `name` | `string` | The fully qualified name of this interface, including package name followed by the interface's simple name. |
| `methods` | [[]google.protobuf.Method](../api.proto.sk/#method) | The methods of this interface, in unspecified order. |
| `options` | [[]google.protobuf.Option](../type.proto.sk/#option) | Any metadata attached to the interface. |
| `version` | `string` | A version string for this interface. If specified, must have the form `major-version.minor-version`, as in `1.10`. If the minor version is omitted, it defaults to zero. If the entire version field is empty, the major version is derived from the package name, as outlined below. If the field is not empty, the version in the package name will be verified to be consistent with what is provided here. The versioning schema uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) where the major version number indicates a breaking change and the minor version an additive, non-breaking change. Both version numbers are signals to users what to expect from different versions, and should be carefully chosen based on the product plan. The major version is also reflected in the package name of the interface, which must end in `v<major-version>`, as in `google.feature.v1`. For major versions 0 and 1, the suffix can be omitted. Zero major versions must only be used for experimental, non-GA interfaces. |
| `sourceContext` | [.google.protobuf.SourceContext](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/source-context) | Source context for the protocol buffer service represented by this message. |
| `mixins` | [[]google.protobuf.Mixin](../api.proto.sk/#mixin) | Included interfaces. See [Mixin][]. |
| `syntax` | [.google.protobuf.Syntax](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/syntax) | The source syntax of the service. |

### Method

 
Method represents a method of an API interface.

```yaml
"name": string
"requestTypeUrl": string
"requestStreaming": bool
"responseTypeUrl": string
"responseStreaming": bool
"options": []google.protobuf.Option
"syntax": .google.protobuf.Syntax

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `name` | `string` | The simple name of this method. |
| `requestTypeUrl` | `string` | A URL of the input message type. |
| `requestStreaming` | `bool` | If true, the request is streamed. |
| `responseTypeUrl` | `string` | The URL of the output message type. |
| `responseStreaming` | `bool` | If true, the response is streamed. |
| `options` | [[]google.protobuf.Option](../type.proto.sk/#option) | Any metadata attached to the method. |
| `syntax` | [.google.protobuf.Syntax](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/syntax) | The source syntax of this method. |

### Mixin

 
Declares an API Interface to be included in this interface. The including
interface must redeclare all the methods from the included interface, but
documentation and options are inherited as follows:

- If after comment and whitespace stripping, the documentation
  string of the redeclared method is empty, it will be inherited
  from the original method.

- Each annotation belonging to the service config (http,
  visibility) which is not set in the redeclared method will be
  inherited.

- If an http annotation is inherited, the path pattern will be
  modified as follows. Any version prefix will be replaced by the
  version of the including interface plus the [root][] path if
  specified.

Example of a simple mixin:

    package google.acl.v1;
    service AccessControl {
      // Get the underlying ACL object.
      rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) {
        option (google.api.http).get = "/v1/{resource=**}:getAcl";
      }
    }

    package google.storage.v2;
    service Storage {
      rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl);

      // Get a data record.
      rpc GetData(GetDataRequest) returns (Data) {
        option (google.api.http).get = "/v2/{resource=**}";
      }
    }

Example of a mixin configuration:

    apis:
    - name: google.storage.v2.Storage
      mixins:
      - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl

The mixin construct implies that all methods in `AccessControl` are
also declared with same name and request/response types in
`Storage`. A documentation generator or annotation processor will
see the effective `Storage.GetAcl` method after inherting
documentation and annotations as follows:

    service Storage {
      // Get the underlying ACL object.
      rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) {
        option (google.api.http).get = "/v2/{resource=**}:getAcl";
      }
      ...
    }

Note how the version in the path pattern changed from `v1` to `v2`.

If the `root` field in the mixin is specified, it should be a
relative path under which inherited HTTP paths are placed. Example:

    apis:
    - name: google.storage.v2.Storage
      mixins:
      - name: google.acl.v1.AccessControl
        root: acls

This implies the following inherited HTTP annotation:

    service Storage {
      // Get the underlying ACL object.
      rpc GetAcl(GetAclRequest) returns (Acl) {
        option (google.api.http).get = "/v2/acls/{resource=**}:getAcl";
      }
      ...
    }

```yaml
"name": string
"root": string

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `name` | `string` | The fully qualified name of the interface which is included. |
| `root` | `string` | If non-empty specifies a path under which inherited HTTP paths are rooted. |
