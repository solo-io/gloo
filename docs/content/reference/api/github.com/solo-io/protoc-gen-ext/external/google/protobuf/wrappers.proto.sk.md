Wrappers for primitive (non-message) types. These types are useful
for embedding primitives in the `google.protobuf.Any` type and for places
where we need to distinguish between the absence of a primitive
typed field and its default value.

These wrappers have no meaningful use within repeated fields as they lack
the ability to detect presence on individual elements.
These wrappers have no meaningful use within a map or a oneof since
individual entries of a map or fields of a oneof can already detect presence.
