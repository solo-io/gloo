### Proxy

 
A Proxy is a container for the entire set of configuration that will to be applied to one or more Proxy instances.
Proxies can be understood as a set of listeners, represents a different bind address/port where the proxy will listen
for connections. Each listener has its own set of configuration.

If any of the sub-resources within a listener is declared invalid (e.g. due to invalid user configuration), the
proxy will be marked invalid by Gloo.

Proxy instances that register with Gloo are assigned the proxy configuration corresponding with
a proxy-specific identifier.
In the case of Envoy, proxy instances are identified by their Node ID. Node IDs must match a existing Proxy
Node ID can be specified in Envoy with the `--service-node` flag, or in the Envoy instance's bootstrap config.

```yaml
"listeners": []gloo.solo.io.Listener
"status": .core.solo.io.Status
"metadata": .core.solo.io.Metadata

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `listeners` | [[]gloo.solo.io.Listener](../proxy.proto.sk/#listener) | Define here each listener the proxy should create. Listeners define the a set of behaviors for a single bind address/port where the proxy will listen If no listeners are specified, the instances configured with the proxy resource will not accept connections. |
| `status` | [.core.solo.io.Status](../../../../../../solo-kit/api/v1/status.proto.sk/#status) | Status indicates the validation status of this resource. Status is read-only by clients, and set by gloo during validation. |
| `metadata` | [.core.solo.io.Metadata](../../../../../../solo-kit/api/v1/metadata.proto.sk/#metadata) | Metadata contains the object metadata for this resource. |




---
### Listener

 
Listeners define the address:port where the proxy will listen for incoming connections
A Listener accepts connections (currently only HTTP is supported) and apply user-defined behavior for those connections,
e.g. performing SSL termination, HTTP retries, and rate limiting.

Only one of `forwardSniClusterName`, `single`, or `upstreamGroup` can be set. |




---
### HttpListener

 
Use this listener to configure proxy behavior for any HTTP-level features including defining routes (via virtual services).
HttpListeners also contain optional configuration that applies globally across all virtual hosts on the listener.
Some traffic policies can be configured to work both on the listener and virtual host level (e.g., the rate limit feature)

```yaml

| `options` | [.gloo.solo.io.HttpListenerOptions](../options.proto.sk/#httplisteneroptions) | HttpListenerOptions contains optional top-level configuration to be applied to a listener. Listener config is applied to traffic for the given listener. Some configuration here can be overridden in VirtualHostOptions configuration, RouteOptions configuration, or WeightedDestinationOptions configuration. |
| `statPrefix` | `string` | prefix for addressing envoy stats for the http connection manager. |




---
### VirtualHost

 
Virtual Hosts group an ordered list of routes under one or more domains.
Each Virtual Host has a logical name, which must be unique for the listener.
An HTTP request is first matched to a virtual host based on its host header, then to a route within the virtual host.
If a request is not matched to any virtual host or a route therein, the target proxy will reply with a 404.

```yaml
"name": string
"domains": []string
"routes": []gloo.solo.io.Route
"options": .gloo.solo.io.VirtualHostOptions
"metadata": .google.protobuf.Struct

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `name` | `string` | the logical name of the virtual host. names must be unique for each virtual host within a listener. |
| `domains` | `[]string` | The list of domains (i.e.: matching the `Host` header of a request) that belong to this virtual host. Note that the wildcard will not match the empty string. e.g. “*-bar.foo.com” will match “baz-bar.foo.com” but not “-bar.foo.com”. Additionally, a special entry “*” is allowed which will match any host/authority header. Only a single virtual host in the entire route configuration can match on “*”. A domain must be unique across all virtual hosts or the config will be invalidated by Gloo Domains on virtual hosts obey the same rules as [Envoy Virtual Hosts](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/master/api/envoy/api/v2/route/route.proto). |
| `routes` | [[]gloo.solo.io.Route](../proxy.proto.sk/#route) | The list of HTTP routes define routing actions to be taken for incoming HTTP requests whose host header matches this virtual host. If the request matches more than one route in the list, the first route matched will be selected. If the list of routes is empty, the virtual host will be ignored by Gloo. |
| `options` | [.gloo.solo.io.VirtualHostOptions](../options.proto.sk/#virtualhostoptions) | Virtual host options contain additional configuration to be applied to all traffic served by the Virtual Host. Some configuration here can be overridden by Route Options. |
| `metadata` | [.google.protobuf.Struct](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/struct) | Metadata for the individual virtual host This data is opaque to Gloo, used by controllers to track ownership of virtual hosts within a proxy as they are typically generated by a controller (such as the gateway). |




---
### Route

 
*
Routes declare the entry points on virtual hosts and the action to take for matched requests.

```yaml
"matchers": []matchers.core.gloo.solo.io.Matcher
"routeAction": .gloo.solo.io.RouteAction
"redirectAction": .gloo.solo.io.RedirectAction
"directResponseAction": .gloo.solo.io.DirectResponseAction

| `matchers` | [[]matchers.core.gloo.solo.io.Matcher](../core/matchers/matchers.proto.sk/#matcher) | Matchers contain parameters for matching requests (i.e., based on HTTP path, headers, etc.) If empty, the route will match all requests (i.e, a single "/" path prefix matcher). |
| `routeAction` | [.gloo.solo.io.RouteAction](../proxy.proto.sk/#routeaction) | This action is the primary action to be selected for most routes. The RouteAction tells the proxy to route requests to an upstream. Only one of `routeAction`, or `directResponseAction` can be set. |
| `redirectAction` | [.gloo.solo.io.RedirectAction](../proxy.proto.sk/#redirectaction) | Redirect actions tell the proxy to return a redirect response to the downstream client. Only one of `redirectAction`, or `directResponseAction` can be set. |
| `directResponseAction` | [.gloo.solo.io.DirectResponseAction](../proxy.proto.sk/#directresponseaction) | Return an arbitrary HTTP response directly, without proxying. Only one of `directResponseAction`, or `redirectAction` can be set. |
| `options` | [.gloo.solo.io.RouteOptions](../options.proto.sk/#routeoptions) | Route Options extend the behavior of routes. Route options include configuration such as retries, rate limiting, and request/response transformation. |
| `metadata` | [.google.protobuf.Struct](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/struct) | Metadata for the individual route This data is opaque to Gloo, used by controllers to track ownership of routes within a proxy as they are typically generated by a controller (such as the gateway). |
| `name` | `string` | The name provides a convenience for users to be able to refer to a route by name. It includes names of vs, route, and route table ancestors of the route. |




---
### RouteAction

 
RouteActions are used to route matched requests to upstreams.

```yaml
"single": .gloo.solo.io.Destination
"multi": .gloo.solo.io.MultiDestination
"upstreamGroup": .core.solo.io.ResourceRef
"clusterHeader": string

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `single` | [.gloo.solo.io.Destination](../proxy.proto.sk/#destination) | Use SingleDestination to route to a single upstream. Only one of `single`, `multi`, or `clusterHeader` can be set. |
| `multi` | [.gloo.solo.io.MultiDestination](../proxy.proto.sk/#multidestination) | Use MultiDestination to load balance requests between multiple upstreams (by weight). Only one of `multi`, `single`, or `clusterHeader` can be set. |
| `upstreamGroup` | [.core.solo.io.ResourceRef](../../../../../../solo-kit/api/v1/ref.proto.sk/#resourceref) | Use a reference to an upstream group for routing. Only one of `upstreamGroup`, `single`, or `clusterHeader` can be set. |
| `clusterHeader` | `string` | Envoy will determine the cluster to route to by reading the value of the HTTP header named by cluster_header from the request headers. If the header is not found or the referenced cluster does not exist, Envoy will return a 404 response. Avoid using this whenever possible, it does not allow for custom filter configuration based on Virtual Host. Only one of `clusterHeader`, `single`, or `upstreamGroup` can be set. |




---
### Destination

 
Destinations define routable destinations for proxied requests.

```yaml
"upstream": .core.solo.io.ResourceRef

| `destinationSpec` | [.gloo.solo.io.DestinationSpec](../options.proto.sk/#destinationspec) | Some upstreams utilize options which require or permit additional configuration on routes targeting them. gRPC upstreams, for example, allow specifying REST-style parameters for JSON-to-gRPC transcoding in the destination config. If the destination config is required for the upstream and not provided by the user, Gloo will invalidate the destination and its parent resources. |
| `subset` | [.gloo.solo.io.Subset](../subset.proto.sk/#subset) | If specified, traffic will only be routed to a subset of the upstream. If upstream doesn't contain the specified subset, we will fallback to normal upstream routing. |
