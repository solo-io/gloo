### UpstreamSpec

 
Static upstreams are used to route request to services listening at fixed IP/Host & Port pairs.
Static upstreams can be used to proxy any kind of service, and therefore contain a ServiceSpec
for additional service-specific configuration.
Unlike upstreams created by service discovery, Static Upstreams must be created manually by users

```yaml
"hosts": []static.options.gloo.solo.io.Host
"useTls": .google.protobuf.BoolValue
"serviceSpec": .options.gloo.solo.io.ServiceSpec
"autoSniRewrite": .google.protobuf.BoolValue

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `hosts` | [[]static.options.gloo.solo.io.Host](../static.proto.sk/#host) | A list of addresses and ports at least one must be specified. |
| `useTls` | [.google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value) | Attempt to use outbound TLS If not explicitly set, Gloo will automatically set this to true for port 443. |
| `serviceSpec` | [.options.gloo.solo.io.ServiceSpec](../../service_spec.proto.sk/#servicespec) | An optional Service Spec describing the service listening at this address. |
| `autoSniRewrite` | [.google.protobuf.BoolValue](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/bool-value) | When set, automatically set the sni address to use to the addr field. If both this and host.sni_addr are set, host.sni_addr has priority. defaults to "true". |




---
### Host

 
Represents a single instance of an upstream

```yaml
"addr": string
"port": int
"sniAddr": string
"loadBalancingWeight": .google.protobuf.UInt32Value
"healthCheckConfig": .static.options.gloo.solo.io.Host.HealthCheckConfig

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `addr` | `string` | Address (hostname or IP). |
| `port` | `int` | Port the instance is listening on. |
| `sniAddr` | `string` | Address to use for SNI if using ssl. |
| `loadBalancingWeight` | [.google.protobuf.UInt32Value](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/csharp/class/google/protobuf/well-known-types/u-int-32-value) | The optional load balancing weight of the upstream host; at least 1. Envoy uses the load balancing weight in some of the built in load balancers. The load balancing weight for an endpoint is divided by the sum of the weights of all endpoints in the endpoint's locality to produce a percentage of traffic for the endpoint. This percentage is then further weighted by the endpoint's locality's load balancing weight from LocalityLbEndpoints. If unspecified, each host is presumed to have equal weight in a locality. |
| `healthCheckConfig` | [.static.options.gloo.solo.io.Host.HealthCheckConfig](../static.proto.sk/#healthcheckconfig) | (Enterprise Only): Host specific health checking configuration. |




---
### HealthCheckConfig



```yaml
"path": string
"method": string

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `path` | `string` | (Enterprise Only): Path to use when health checking this specific host. |
| `method` | `string` | (Enterprise Only): Method to use when health checking this specific host. |
