### ResourceLocator

 
xDS resource locators identify a xDS resource name and instruct the
data-plane load balancer on how the resource may be located.

Resource locators have a canonical xdstp:// URI representation:

  xdstp://{authority}/{type_url}/{id}?{context_params}{#directive,*}

where context_params take the form of URI query parameters.

Resource locators have a similar canonical http:// URI representation:

  http://{authority}/{type_url}/{id}?{context_params}{#directive,*}

Resource locators also have a simplified file:// URI representation:

  file:///{id}{#directive,*}

```yaml
"scheme": .xds.core.v3.ResourceLocator.Scheme
"id": string
"authority": string
"resourceType": string
"exactContext": .xds.core.v3.ContextParams
"directives": []xds.core.v3.ResourceLocator.Directive

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `scheme` | [.xds.core.v3.ResourceLocator.Scheme](../resource_locator.proto.sk/#scheme) | URI scheme. |
| `id` | `string` | Opaque identifier for the resource. Any '/' will not be escaped during URI encoding and will form part of the URI path. This may end with ‘*’ for glob collection references. |
| `authority` | `string` | Logical authority for resource (not necessarily transport network address). Authorities are opaque in the xDS API, data-plane load balancers will map them to concrete network transports such as an xDS management server, e.g. via envoy.config.core.v3.ConfigSource. |
| `resourceType` | `string` | Fully qualified resource type (as in type URL without types.googleapis.com/ prefix). |
| `exactContext` | [.xds.core.v3.ContextParams](../context_params.proto.sk/#contextparams) | Additional parameters that can be used to select resource variants. Matches must be exact, i.e. all context parameters must match exactly and there must be no additional context parameters set on the matched resource. |
| `directives` | [[]xds.core.v3.ResourceLocator.Directive](../resource_locator.proto.sk/#directive) | A list of directives that appear in the xDS resource locator #fragment. When encoding to URI form, directives are percent encoded with comma separation. |

### Directive

 
Directives provide information to data-plane load balancers on how xDS
resource names are to be interpreted and potentially further resolved. For
example, they may provide alternative resource locators for when primary
resolution fails. Directives are not part of resource names and do not
appear in a xDS transport discovery request.

When encoding to URIs, directives take the form:

<directive name>=<string representation of directive value>

For example, we can have alt=xdstp://foo/bar or entry=some%20thing. Each
directive value type may have its own string encoding, in the case of
ResourceLocator there is a recursive URI encoding.

Percent encoding applies to the URI encoding of the directive value.
Multiple directives are comma-separated, so the reserved characters that
require percent encoding in a directive value are [',', '#', '[', ']',
'%']. These are the RFC3986 fragment reserved characters with the addition
of the xDS scheme specific ','. See
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#page-49 for further details on URI ABNF
and reserved characters.

```yaml
"alt": .xds.core.v3.ResourceLocator
"entry": string

```

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- | 
| `alt` | [.xds.core.v3.ResourceLocator](../resource_locator.proto.sk/#resourcelocator) | An alternative resource locator for fallback if the resource is unavailable. For example, take the resource locator: xdstp://foo/some-type/some-route-table#alt=xdstp://bar/some-type/another-route-table If the data-plane load balancer is unable to reach `foo` to fetch the resource, it will fallback to `bar`. Alternative resources do not need to have equivalent content, but they should be functional substitutes. Only one of `alt` or `entry` can be set. |
| `entry` | `string` | List collections support inlining of resources via the entry field in Resource. These inlined Resource objects may have an optional name field specified. When specified, the entry directive allows ResourceLocator to directly reference these inlined resources, e.g. xdstp://.../foo#entry=bar. Only one of `entry` or `alt` can be set. |
