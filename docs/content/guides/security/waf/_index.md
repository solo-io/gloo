Filter, monitor, and block potentially harmful HTTP traffic with a Web Application Firewall (WAF) policy.

{{% notice note %}}
The WAF feature was introduced with **Gloo Gateway Enterprise**, release 0.18.23. If you are using an earlier version, this tutorial will not work.

## About web application firewalls

WAFs protect your web apps by monitoring, filtering, and blocking potentially harmful HTTP traffic. You write a WAF policy by following a framework and ruleset. Then, you apply the WAF policy to the route for the apps that you want to protect. When Gloo Gateway receives an incoming request for that route (ingress traffic), the WAF intercepts and inspects the network packets and uses the rules that you set in the policy to determine access to the web app. The WAF policy also applies to any outgoing responses (egress traffic) along the route. This setup provides an additional layer of protection between your apps and end users.

In this section, you can learn about the following WAF topics:
* [ModSecurity rule sets](#about-rule-sets)
* [The WAF API](#about-api)
* [An example WAF configuration](#about-example)

### ModSecurity rule sets {#about-rule-sets}

Gloo supports the popular Web Application Firewall framework and ruleset [ModSecurity](https://www.github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity) **version 3.0.4**. ModSecurity uses a simple rules language to interpret and process incoming HTTP traffic. Because it is open source, ModSecurity is a flexible, cross-platform solution that incorporates transparent security practices to protect apps against a range web attacks. 

You have several options for using ModSecurity to write WAF policies:
* Use publicly available rule sets that provide a generic set of detection rules to protect against the most common security threats. For example, the [OWASP Core Rule Set](https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset) is an open source project that protects apps against a wide range of attacks, including the "OWASP Top Ten."
* Write your own custom rules by following the [ModSecurity rules language](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-(v3.x)). For examples, see [Configure WAF policies](#configure-waf-policies).


### Understand the WAF API {#about-api}

The WAF filter supports a list of `RuleSet` objects which are loaded into the ModSecurity library.  The Gloo Gateway API has a few conveniences built on top of that to allow easier access to the OWASP Core Rule Set (via the [`coreRuleSet`](#core-rule-set) field). 

You can disable each rule set on a route independently of other rule sets. Rule sets are applied on top of each other in order. This order means that later rule sets overwrite any conflicting rules in previous rule sets. For more fine-grained control, you can add a custom `rule_str`, which is applied after any files of rule sets.

Review the following `RuleSet`

```proto
message ModSecurity {
    // Disable all rules on the current route
    bool disabled = 1;
    // Global rule sets for the current http connection manager
    repeated RuleSet rule_sets = 2;
    // Custom message to display when an intervention occurs
    string custom_intervention_message = 3;
}

message RuleSet {
    // string of rules which are added directly
    string rule_str = 1;
    // array of files to include
    repeated string files = 3;
}
```

### Example WAF configuration {#about-example}

This tutorial does not provide guidance on rule sets, but instead how to apply rule sets within Gloo Gateway configuration. For more information about making rule sets, see the [ModSecurity docs](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-(v3.x)).

The following example is for a rule set that is written directly into the configuration as a string. It does two things:
1. This rule enables the rules engine (`On`), which is `Off` by default. You must explicitly turn the engine on. To run the rules engine to detect and log requests, but not to intervene such as by denying the request, you can set this value to `DetectionOnly`.
2. This rule inspects the request header `"user-agent"`. If the value of that header equals `"scammer"`, then the gateway denies the request and returns a 403 status. The WAF logs the rule message `blocked scammer`, which you might use as input in other custom rules.

```yaml
  ruleSets:
    - ruleStr: |
        # Turn rule engine on
        SecRuleEngine On
        # Deny requests which are container the header value user-agent:scammer
        SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS:User-Agent "scammer" "deny,status:403,id:107,phase:1,msg:'blocked scammer'"
```

## Before you begin

1. [Install Gloo Gateway Enterprise]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/installation/enterprise/" %}}) in a Kubernetes cluster.
2. Deploy the [petstore example app]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/traffic_management/hello_world/" %}}).
3. Optional: If you have not already, review the [conceptual information about the WAF filter](#about-web-application-firewalls), including ModSecurity rule sets, the WAF API, and the example WAF configuration.

## Configure WAF policies
You can configure ModSecurity rule sets in the following resources:

* [`HttpGateway`](#http-gateway)
* [`VirtualService`](#virtual-service)
* `Route`

The precedence for rules is the route, then the virtual service, and then the HTTP gateway.

The configuration of the WAF filter in the three resources is very similar and follows the same pattern as other enterprise features in Gloo Gateway.

### HTTP gateway

The first option for configuring WAF is on the HTTP gateway level on the `Gateway` resource. You might configure the WAF rule sets on the HTTP gateway level so that the rules apply to all incoming requests to a given address, and not specific subsets.

1. Edit the gateway object.
   ```bash
   kubectl edit gateway -n gloo-system gateway-proxy
   ```
2. Add the following `waf` section to the `httpGateway.options` section.
   {{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=11-19" >}}
   apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
   kind: Gateway
   metadata:
     name: gateway-proxy
     namespace: gloo-system
   spec:
     bindAddress: '::'
     bindPort: 8080
     proxyNames:
     - gateway-proxy
     httpGateway:
       options:
         waf:
           customInterventionMessage: 'ModSecurity intervention! Custom message details here..'
           ruleSets:
           - ruleStr: |
               # Turn rule engine on
               SecRuleEngine On
               SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS:User-Agent "scammer" "deny,status:403,id:107,phase:1,msg:'blocked scammer'"
     useProxyProto: false
   {{< / highlight >}}
3. Verify that the WAF filter is enabled by curling the route with the `User-Agent:scammer` header.
   ```bash
   curl -v -H User-Agent:scammer $(glooctl proxy url)/sample-route-1
   ```
   In the output, note that the request is blocked with a 403 response and the custom intervention message that you configured.
   ```
   *   Trying 192.168.99.144...
   * TCP_NODELAY set
   * Connected to 192.168.99.144 (192.168.99.144) port 32683 (#0)
   > GET /sample-route-1 HTTP/1.1
   > Host: 192.168.99.144:32683
   > Accept: */*
   > user-agent:scammer
   >
   < HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
   < content-length: 55
   < content-type: text/plain
   < date: Tue, 29 Oct 2019 19:53:38 GMT
   < server: envoy
   <
   * Connection #0 to host 192.168.99.144 left intact
   ModSecurity intervention! Custom message details here..
   ```

### Virtual service

If you want to set up rules only for a particular app, you can configure the WAF rule sets in that app's virtual destination.

1. Edit the gateway object to remove the `waf` section that you added in the [HTTP gateway instructions](#http-gateway).
   ```bash
   kubectl edit gateway -n gloo-system gateway-proxy
   ```
2. Edit the virtual service.
   ```bash
   kubectl edit virtualservices.gateway.solo.io -n gloo-system default
   ```
3. Add the following `waf` section to the `spec.virtualHost.options` section.
   {{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=6-13" >}}
   ...
   spec:
     virtualHost:
       domains:
       - '*'
       options:
         waf:
           customInterventionMessage: 'ModSecurity intervention! Custom message details here..'
           ruleSets:
           - ruleStr: |
               # Turn rule engine on
               SecRuleEngine On
               SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS:User-Agent "scammer" "deny,status:403,id:107,phase:1,msg:'blocked scammer'"
   ...
   {{< / highlight >}}
3. Verify that the WAF filter is enabled by curling the route with the `User-Agent:scammer` header.
   ```bash
   curl -v -H User-Agent:scammer $(glooctl proxy url)/sample-route-1
   ```
   In the output, note that the request is blocked with a 403 response and the custom intervention message that you configured.

### What's next?

Now that you are familiar with how to apply WAF rule sets in Gloo Gateway, try out the following more advanced use cases.
* Dynamically apply updates to rule sets by using [Kubernetes configmaps](#dynamic-configmaps).
* Apply the [OWASP core rule set](#core-rule-set).
* Restrict access to a specific [IP address or subnet range](#ip-allowlist).
* For [gRPC calls](#grpc), configure headers to avoid timeouts.
* Enable [audit logging](#audit-logging).

## Dynamically load rule sets with Kubernetes configmaps {#dynamic-configmaps}

In the previous examples, you wrote the rule set directly into the WAF filter configuration. For a more scalable approach, you might prefer to write the rule sets outside of the configuration in a separate file. To dynamically load files so that updates are picked up by the WAF filter configuration, use Kubernetes configmaps.

1. Create your rule sets as a single or separate files.{{% notice tip %}}Tip: Separate files can complicate how rule sets are applied. If possible, include the rules in a single file. This example uses separate files so that you learn how to set up orders later in the configmap and data map keys.{{% /notice %}}
   ```bash
   cat <<EOF > wafruleset.conf
   SecRuleEngine On
   SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS:User-Agent "scammer" "deny,status:403,id:107,phase:1,msg:'blocked scammer'"
   EOF
   
   cat <<EOF > wafruleset2.conf
   SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS:User-Agent "scammer2" "deny,status:403,id:108,phase:1,msg:'blocked scammer2'"
   EOF
   ```
2. Create a Kubernetes configmap from your rule set files.
   ```bash
   kubectl --namespace=gloo-system create configmap wafruleset --from-file=wafruleset2.conf --from-file=wafruleset.conf 
   ```
3. Verify that the configmap contains all of your rules. Each filename becomes a separate entry in the `data` section.
And view this configmap

   ```bash
   kubectl --namespace=gloo-system get configmap wafruleset -oyaml
   ```

   Example output:
   
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   data:
     wafruleset.conf: |
       SecRuleEngine On
       SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS:User-Agent "scammer" "deny,status:403,id:107,phase:1,msg:'blocked scammer'"
     wafruleset2.conf: |
       SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS:User-Agent "scammer2" "deny,status:403,id:108,phase:1,msg:'blocked scammer2'"
   ```

4. Update the `Gateway` or `VirtualService` resource to refer to the ConfigMap for your WAF filter configuration. The following example does not set the `dataMapKey` field for the ConfigMap rule set. Therefore, all key-value pairs in the ConfigMap `data` section are sorted by key and applied in sorted key order. In this case the rule for `wafruleset.conf` is applied first, followed by the rule for `wafruleset2.conf`. 

   ```bash
   kubectl edit gateway -n gloo-system gateway-proxy
   ```
   {{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=15-18" >}}
   apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
   kind: Gateway
   metadata:
     name: gateway-proxy
     namespace: gloo-system
   spec:
     bindAddress: '::'
     bindPort: 8080
     proxyNames:
     - gateway-proxy
     httpGateway:
       options:
         waf:
           customInterventionMessage: 'ModSecurity intervention! Custom message details here..'
           configMapRuleSets:
           - configMapRef:
               name: wafruleset
               namespace: gloo-system
     useProxyProto: false
   {{< / highlight >}}
5. Verify that the WAF filter is enabled by curling the route with the `User-Agent:scammer` header. In the output, note that the request is blocked with a 403 response and the custom intervention message that you configured.
   ```bash
   curl -v -H User-Agent:scammer $(glooctl proxy url)/sample-route-1
   ```
6. Verify that the rule in `wafruleset2.conf` is also applied by curling the route with the `User-Agent:scammer2` header.
   ```bash
   curl -v -H User-Agent:scammer2 $(glooctl proxy url)/sample-route-1
   ```
7. Optional: To apply a certain rule or a certain order for the rules, add the `dataMapKeys` section. If you only want rules from one key in the data in your ConfigMap, or you want to specify a certain order you can use the keys from the data map. The following examples configures only the rule in the `wafruleset.conf` key in the data section of your ConfigMap. If multiple `dataMapKeys` are specified, the rules are applied in the order that the keys are listed. Any rules not included are ignored.
   ```bash
   kubectl edit gateway -n gloo-system gateway-proxy
   ```
   {{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=19-20" >}}
   apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
   kind: Gateway
   metadata:
     name: gateway-proxy
     namespace: gloo-system
   spec:
     bindAddress: '::'
     bindPort: 8080
     proxyNames:
     - gateway-proxy
     httpGateway:
       options:
         waf:
           customInterventionMessage: 'ModSecurity intervention! Custom message details here..'
           configMapRuleSets:
           - configMapRef:
               name: wafruleset
               namespace: gloo-system
             dataMapKeys:
             - wafruleset.conf
     useProxyProto: false
   {{< / highlight >}}
8. Verify that the rule in `wafruleset2.conf` is now ignored. The request succeeds, because only the rule in `wafruleset.conf` is applied for the `User-Agent:scammer` header, not the `User-Agent:scammer2` header.
   ```bash
   curl -v -H User-Agent:scammer2 $(glooctl proxy url)/sample-route-1
   ```

## Apply the OWASP core rule set {#core-rule-set}

{{% notice warning %}}
Using the `rbl` modsecurity rule in Gloo Gateway will cause envoy performance issues and should be avoided. If `rbl` blacklisting is a requirement, an [extauth plugin]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/security/auth/extauth/plugin_auth">}}) can be used to query the rbl list and forbid spam IPs.
{{% /notice %}}

As mentioned earlier, the main free ModSecurity rule set available is the OWASP Core Rule Set. As with all other rule sets, the Core Rule Set can be applied manually via the rule set configs, Gloo Gateway offers an easy way to apply the entire Core Rule Set, and configure it.

In order to apply the Core Rule Set add the following to the default virtual service. Without the coreRuleSet field, the OWASP Core Rule Set files will not be included.

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=7-33" >}}
spec:
  virtualHost:
    domains:
    - '*'
    name: gloo-system.default
    options:
      waf:
        coreRuleSet:
          customSettingsString: |
              # default rules section
              SecRuleEngine On
              SecRequestBodyAccess On
              # CRS section
              # Will block by default
              SecDefaultAction "phase:1,log,auditlog,deny,status:403"
              SecDefaultAction "phase:2,log,auditlog,deny,status:403"
              # only allow http2 connections
              SecAction \
                "id:900230,\
                  phase:1,\
                  nolog,\
                  pass,\
                  t:none,\
                  setvar:'tx.allowed_http_versions=HTTP/2 HTTP/2.0'"
              SecAction \
              "id:900990,\
                phase:1,\
                nolog,\
                pass,\
                t:none,\
                    setvar:tx.crs_setup_version=310"
{{< / highlight >}}

Once this config has been accepted run the following to test that it works.
```bash
curl -v $(glooctl proxy url)/sample-route-1
```
should respond with
```
*   Trying 192.168.99.145...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to 192.168.99.145 (192.168.99.145) port 30093 (#0)
> GET /sample-route-1 HTTP/1.1
> Host: 192.168.99.145:30093
> User-Agent: curl/7.54.0
> Accept: */*

< server: envoy
<
* Connection #0 to host 192.168.99.145 left intact
ModSecurity: intervention occurred
```
There are a couple important things to note from the config above. The `coreRuleSet` object is the first. By setting this object to non-nil the `coreRuleSet` is automatically applied to the gateway/vhost/route is has been added to. The Core Rule Set can be applied manually as well if a specific version of it is required which we do not mount into the container. The second thing to note is the config string. This config string is an important part of configuring the Core Rule Set, an example of which can be found [here](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/blob/v3.2/dev/crs-setup.conf.example).


## IP Allowlist

A very common use case in many organizations is restricting access for an API to a specific IP address or subnet range. This requirement manifests in many ways, such as maintaining an access control list (ACL) for certain internal services or enforcing network boundaries between various, discrete environments.

We can utilize the WAF filter and custom modsecurity rules to easily satisfy these requirements. To illustrate this concept, we will outline how to restrict access to a service to our workstation's IP along with any other hosts that are in the same `/16` CIDR block as our IP. This IP whitelisting will be based on the original source IP of a request originating from a developer workstation and flowing through a cloud `LoadBalancer` provisioned by the Kubernetes `Service`.

Since we will be whitelisting IPs that travel through our cloud provider's `LoadBalancer`, we need to ensure the original source IP is preserved. Most commonly, this is configured on `Service` resources by setting the `externalTrafficPolicy: Local`. For our purposes, we will patch the 'gateway-proxy' `Service`:

```
spec:
  externalTrafficPolicy: Local
```

Now the workload behind this `Service` will correctly see the original client IP as the remote address connecting to it. We can then utilize this address in our WAF rules to implement IP whitelisting. In this case, we will add the following patch to our `VirtualService`:

```
spec:
  virtualHost:
    options:
      waf:
        ruleSets:
        - ruleStr: |
            SecRuleEngine On
            SecRule REMOTE_ADDR "!@ipMatch 173.175.0.0/16" "phase:1,deny,status:403,id:1,msg:'block ip'"
```

We are applying a WAF rule at the `virtualHost` level, meaning that the rule will be applied to all routes for this `VirtualService`. The rule we are applying will cause modsecurity to inspect the remote address for the request being processed and if the IP address does not fall in the `173.175.0.0/16` network range, the request will be denied with a 403 status code.

## gRPC 

If you have configured WAF, gRPC calls to a VirtualService fronting a gRPC services may timeout if the gRPC call is a stream
as the WAF filter requires an end stream to be specified to finish evaluating intervention. To avoid this timeout, add `requestHeadersOnly: true` and `responseHeadersOnly: true` to the WAF config:

```yaml
waf:
  requestHeadersOnly: true
  responseHeadersOnly: true
  customInterventionMessage: ModSecurity intervention! Custom message details here..
  ruleSets:
  - ruleStr: |
      # Turn rule engine on
      SecRuleEngine On
      SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS:User-Agent "scammer" "deny,status:403,id:107,phase:1,msg:'blocked scammer'"
```

## Audit Logging

Audit Logging is supported starting Gloo Gateway Enterprise v1.4.0, but it works differently than in other ModSecurity integrations.
ModSecurity native audit logging is not a good fit for Envoy/Kubernetes cloud native environments.
ModSecurity has 3 logging engines. They are not a good fit for the following reasons:
1. Serial - all logs written to one file, which globally locks on each write. This will be horrendous
   for performance, as all envoy worker threads will be blocked when trying to log while one-by-one they write to the file.
2. Parallel - each log entry is written to its unique file. This will impact performance as this file IO is 
   outside the envoy worker thread event loop, thus blocking it and increasing latency. In addition,
   now we will have many logs files to collect from the pod. This means we'll a need writeable volume attached via sidecar 
   container to collect them which increases complexity.
3. Http - perform an http callout to an external logging server - like the other methods, this http call
   is done outside the envoy event loop, blocking it until it is completed, which will increase latency.

With this integration, we take a more cloud native approach. We expose the audit logs as part
of envoy's access logging. This means that directives that configure the audit engine itself 
([SecAuditEngine](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-%28v2.x%29#SecAuditEngine), [SecAuditLog](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-%28v2.x%29#SecAuditLog), [SecAuditLogStorageDir](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-%28v2.x%29#SecAuditLogStorageDir), [SecAuditLogType](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-%28v2.x%29#SecAuditLogType), ...) are
**ignored even if they are set**.
This is **intentional** - to make sure that ModSecurity doesn't degrade
envoy performance. While the way we emit the logs is different, you have _all the features_ that 
ModSecurity audit-logging provides:
- You can use the `action` property of the audit logging configuration instead of [SecAuditEngine](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-%28v2.x%29#SecAuditEngine) to choose when to log.
- You can still use the [SecAuditLogParts](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-%28v2.x%29#SecAuditLogParts), 
[SecAuditLogRelevantStatus](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-%28v2.x%29#SecAuditLogRelevantStatus) and (assuming action is RELEVANT_ONLY) `noauditlog` features of ModSecurity.
- The format of the log is controlled by [SecAuditLogFormat](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-%28v2.x%29#SecAuditLogFormat).

As envoy access logs have their own filtering mechanism built in, we provide two methods of exposing the audit logs via the access logs. Each method has different CPU/Memory trade-offs.

- DynamicMetadata - This processes the audit log eagerly every time it is required. This may increase CPU
as the audit log will be computed even if envoy doesn't end-up logging it. To use, place `%DYNAMIC_METADATA(io.solo.filters.http.modsecurity:audit_log)%` in the access log.
- FilterState - this will only generate an AuditLog lazily - only if the envoy access log is about to log it. This will use
less CPU if the message is not logged, but may use more memory, as the ModSecurity transaction 
will linger in memory longer. To use, place `%FILTER_STATE(io.solo.modsecurity.audit_log)%` in the access log.

{{% notice warning %}}
[Data Loss Prevention (DLP)]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/security/data_loss_prevention/" %}}) is **not supported** with FilterState access logging.
{{% /notice %}}

We recommend testing both in an environment similar to your prod environment, to understand which approach
is better for your specific use-case.

Let's see this in action!

To enable audit logging, edit the auditLogging field in your WAF settings.

For example, lets edit our `VirtualService` with some
rules and audit logging:

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=6-8 15" >}}
...
spec:
  virtualHost:
    options:
      waf:
        auditLogging:
          action: ALWAYS
          location: FILTER_STATE
        ruleSets:
        - ruleStr: |
            # Turn rule engine on
            SecRuleEngine On
            # Set audit log format to JSON. leave this out to use the
            # regular string format.
            SecAuditLogFormat JSON
            # A simple rule to catch a "scammer"
            SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS:User-Agent "scammer" "deny,status:403,id:107,phase:1,msg:'blocked scammer'"

Enable access logs:

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=13-19" >}}
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway-proxy
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  bindAddress: '::'
  bindPort: 8080
  proxyNames: 
    - gateway-proxy
  httpGateway: {}
  useProxyProto: false
  options:
    accessLoggingService:
      accessLog:
      - fileSink:
          path: /dev/stderr
          stringFormat: "%FILTER_STATE(io.solo.modsecurity.audit_log)%\n"
{{< / highlight >}}

Generate a request that will trigger ModSecurity:
```shell
curl -v $(glooctl proxy url) -H "user-agent: scammer"
```

Check the logs:
```shell
kubectl -n gloo-system logs deploy/gateway-proxy
```

and you should see the following output:
```json
{"transaction":{"request":{"http_version":1.1,"body":"","headers":{":path":"/api/pets/1","x-forwarded-proto":"http","accept":"*/*","host":"172.17.0.2:32608","user-agent":"scammer",":authority":"172.17.0.2:32608",":method":"GET","x-request-id":"a91986b2-5928-427e-a557-15f5cbeec104"},"uri":"/api/pets/1","method":"GET"},"host_port":0,"host_ip":"","unique_id":"158879653826.189180","client_ip":"10.244.0.1","time_stamp":"Wed May  6 20:22:18 2020","messages":[{"message":"blocked scammer","details":{"maturity":"0","match":"Matched \"Operator `Rx' with parameter `scammer' against variable `REQUEST_HEADERS:user-agent' (Value: `scammer' )","reference":"o0,7v133,7","lineNumber":"7","ruleId":"107","severity":"0","file":"\u003c\u003creference missing or not informed\u003e\u003e","ver":"","rev":"","data":"","tags":[],"accuracy":"0"}}],"client_port":48839,"producer":{"secrules_engine":"Enabled","modsecurity":"ModSecurity v3.0.4 (Linux)","components":[],"connector":"envoy v0.1.0"},"response":{"http_code":200,"headers":{}},"server_id":"4ce9d7cf1298296878f1ae2e9d40de00b290a3a4"}}

{{% notice tip %}}
By default Envoy flushes log files every 10 seconds. To see logs faster while testing this guide, we can set it
to a lower value. To do so, edit the gateway proxy deployment
and add the `--file-flush-interval-msec 100` to the envoy arguments.

The arguments should look like so:
```
      - args:
        - --disable-hot-restart
        - --file-flush-interval-msec
        - "100"
```

### Audit Log Formatting

Alternatively, specify a `jsonFormat` format string to dump ModSecurity logs as part of a larger JSON object:

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=13-21" >}}
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway-proxy
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  bindAddress: '::'
  bindPort: 8080
  proxyNames: 
    - gateway-proxy
  httpGateway: {}
  useProxyProto: false
  options:
    accessLoggingService:
      accessLog:
      - fileSink:
          path: /dev/stderr
          jsonFormat:
            method: '%REQ(:METHOD)%'
            response_code: '%RESPONSE_CODE%'
            waf: "%FILTER_STATE(io.solo.modsecurity.audit_log)%"
{{< / highlight >}}

The above configuration will log a JSON object containing the request method, response code, and any logs obtained from ModSecurity when a request is processed.
