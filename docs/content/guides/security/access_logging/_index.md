title: Access Logging
weight: 40
description: Produce an access log representing traffic passing through the proxy
---

A common use case for the API gateway is to produce an **access log** (sometimes referred to as an audit log). The entries of an access log represent traffic through the proxy. The access log entries can be customized to include 
data from the request, the routing destination, and the response. The proxy can be configured to output multiple access logs with different configuration.

An access log may be written locally to a file or the `stdout` pipe in the proxy container, or it can be exported to a gRPC server for custom handling.

With Gloo Gateway (starting in `0.18.1`), access logs can be enabled and customized per Envoy listener by modifying the **Gateway** Custom Resource.

## Data Available for Logging

Envoy exposes a lot of data that can be used when customizing access logs. Some common data properties available for both 
TCP and HTTP access logging include:
* The downstream (client) address, connection info, tls configuration, and timing
* The upstream (service) address, connection info, tls configuration, timing, and envoy routing information
* Relevant envoy configuration, such as rate of sampling (if used)
* Filter-specific context published to Envoy's dynamic metadata during the filter chain

### Additional HTTP Properties

When Envoy is used as an HTTP proxy a large amount of additional HTTP information is available for access logging, including:
* Request data including the method, path, scheme, port, user agent, headers, body, and more 
* Response data including the response code, headers, body, and trailers, as well as a string representation of the response code
* Protocol version

### Additional TCP Properties

Due to the limitations of the TCP protocol, the only additional data available for access logging when using Envoy as a TCP 
proxy are connection properties: bytes received and sent. 

## File-based Access Logging

File-based access logging can be enabled in Gloo Gateway by customizing the **Gateway** CRD. For file-based access logs (also referred to 
as file sink access logs), there are two main configurations to set:
* Path: This is where the logs are written, either to `/dev/stdout` or to a file that is in a writable volume in the proxy container 
* Format: This provides a log template for either string or json-formatted logs

## File-based Standard logging

You can enable file-based standard logging (stdout/stderr) in Gloo Gateway during [Helm installation]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/helm_chart_values/enterprise_helm_chart_values/" %}}). For more information about Envoy logging, see [the Envoy docs](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/start/quick-start/run-envoy#envoy-logging).

To enable, you use the `--log-path path` Helm setting in the `gloo.gatewayProxies.gatewayProxy.extraEnvoyArgs[]` parameter. Because the filesystem is read-only, you must also mount an additional volume in the `gateway-proxy` deployment.

The following steps show an example for Gloo Gateway Enterprise installations. Before you begin, set the Gloo Gateway Enterprise version (`$VERSION`) and license key (`$YOUR_LICENSE_KEY`) as variables. For more information or open source steps, see the [Installation guide]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/installation/" %}}).

1. Prepare a Helm values configuration file with override settings such as the following.
   ```yaml
   gloo:
     gatewayProxies:
       gatewayProxy:
         extraVolumes:
         - name: gloo-logs
           persistentVolumeClaim:
             claimName: local-claim
         extraProxyVolumeMounts:
         - name: gloo-logs
           mountPath: /var/log/gloo
         extraEnvoyArgs: # Add extra arguments to Envoy.
         -  --log-path /var/log/gloo/envoy_log
   ```
2. Upgrade or install the Gloo Gateway Enterprise Helm chart with your override settings.
   ```bash
   helm upgrade --install gloo-gateway gloo-ee/gloo-ee --namespace gloo-system --set-string license_key=$YOUR_LICENSE_KEY --version $VERSION -f value-overrides.yaml
   ```
3. Verify that the `gateway-proxy` deployment mounts the logs volumes.
   ```bash
   kubectl describe -n gloo-system deployment/gateway-proxy
   ```

   Example truncated output:
   ```
   Mounts:
     /etc/envoy from envoy-config (rw)
     /var/log/gloo from gloo-access (rw)
   ```
4. Log into the `gateway-proxy` container.
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it -n gloo-system pods/$(kubectl get pod -l gloo=gateway-proxy -A -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -- /bin/sh
   ```
5. Review the standard output logs in the log path that you added.
   ```
   tail /var/log/gloo/envoy_log
   ```
   
   Example output:
   ```

   ```

## Outputting formatted strings

To configure access logs on a specific Envoy listener that output string-formatted logs to a file, 
we can add an access logging option to the corresponding Gateway CRD. 

For example, here is an example Gateway configuration that logs all requests into the HTTP port to 
standard out, using the [default string format](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.10.0/configuration/access_log#config-access-log-default-format):
```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway-proxy
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  bindAddress: '::'
  bindPort: 8080
  proxyNames: 
    - gateway-proxy
  httpGateway: {}
  useProxyProto: false
  options:
    accessLoggingService:
      accessLog:
      - fileSink:
          path: /dev/stdout
          stringFormat: ""
```

This will cause requests to the HTTP port to be logged to the application logs of the `gateway-proxy` deployment:
```
$ kubectl logs -n gloo-system deploy/gateway-proxy
```

```
[2020-03-17T18:39:54.919Z] "GET /sample-route-1 HTTP/1.1" 200 - 0 86 2 2 "-" "curl/7.54.0" "eb5af05f-f14f-467b-994c-aeac9b5383f1" "35.196.131.38" "10.52.0.54:8080"

[2020-03-17T18:40:33.680Z] "GET /sample-route-1 HTTP/1.1" 200 - 0 86 1 1 "-" "curl/7.54.0" "fe904bec-d2ba-4027-9aa3-fef74dbf927e" "35.196.131.38" "10.52.0.54:8080"
```

### Customizing the string format

In the example above, the default string format was used. Alternatively, a custom string format can be provided explicitly:
```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway-proxy
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  bindAddress: '::'
  bindPort: 8080
  proxyNames: 
    - gateway-proxy
  httpGateway: {}
  useProxyProto: false
  options:
    accessLoggingService:
      accessLog:
      - fileSink:
          path: /dev/stdout
          stringFormat: >
            [%START_TIME%] "%REQ(X-ENVOY-ORIGINAL-METHOD?:METHOD)% %REQ(X-ENVOY-ORIGINAL-PATH?:PATH)% %PROTOCOL%"
            %RESPONSE_CODE% %RESPONSE_FLAGS% %BYTES_RECEIVED% %BYTES_SENT% %DURATION%
            %RESP(X-ENVOY-UPSTREAM-SERVICE-TIME)% "%REQ(X-FORWARDED-FOR)%" "%REQ(USER-AGENT)%"
            "%REQ(X-REQUEST-ID)%" "%REQ(:AUTHORITY)%" "%UPSTREAM_HOST%"
```

This will cause requests to the HTTP port to be logged to the application logs of the `gateway-proxy` deployment:
```
$ kubectl logs -n gloo-system deploy/gateway-proxy
```

```
[2020-03-17T18:49:50.298Z] "GET /sample-route-1 HTTP/1.1" 200 - 0 86 2 2 "-" "curl/7.54.0" "6fce19d1-63a9-438b-94ac-b4ec212b9027" "35.196.131.38" "10.52.0.54:8080"
[2020-03-17T18:49:52.141Z] "GET /sample-route-1 HTTP/1.1" 200 - 0 86 1 0 "-" "curl/7.54.0" "ff80348a-5b69-4485-ac73-73f3fe825532" "35.196.131.38" "10.52.0.54:8080"
[2020-03-17T18:49:53.685Z] "GET /sample-route-1 HTTP/1.1" 200 - 0 86 1 0 "-" "curl/7.54.0" "2a66949f-55e5-4dae-a03c-5f749ce4867c" "35.196.131.38" "10.52.0.54:8080"

```

For more details about the Envoy string format, check out the [envoy docs](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.30.2/configuration/observability/access_log/usage#format-strings). 

### Outputting structured json

Instead of outputting strings, the file sink access logger can be configured to log structured json instead. When 
configuring structured json, the Envoy fields are referenced in the same way as in the string format, however a mapping to json 
keys is defined: 

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway-proxy
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  bindAddress: '::'
  bindPort: 8080
  proxyNames:
    - gateway-proxy
  httpGateway: {}
  useProxyProto: false
  options:
    accessLoggingService:
      accessLog:
        - fileSink:
            path: /dev/stdout
            jsonFormat:
              protocol: "%PROTOCOL%"
              duration: "%DURATION%"
              upstreamCluster: "%UPSTREAM_CLUSTER%"
              upstreamHost: "%UPSTREAM_HOST%"
```

This will cause requests to the HTTP port to be logged to the application logs of the `gateway-proxy` deployment:
```
$ kubectl logs -n gloo-system deploy/gateway-proxy
```

```
{"protocol":"HTTP/1.1","upstreamHost":"10.52.0.54:8080","duration":"4","upstreamCluster":"default-petstore-8080_gloo-system"}
{"upstreamHost":"10.52.0.54:8080","duration":"3","upstreamCluster":"default-petstore-8080_gloo-system","protocol":"HTTP/1.1"}
{"protocol":"HTTP/1.1","upstreamHost":"10.52.0.54:8080","duration":"3","upstreamCluster":"default-petstore-8080_gloo-system"}
```

For more information about json format dictionaries, check out the [Envoy docs](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.10.0/configuration/access_log#format-dictionaries).

### Outputting to a custom file

Instead of outputting the string or json-formatted access logs to standard out, it may be preferable to log them to 
a file local to the container. This requires a volume that is writable in the `gateway-proxy` container.

We'll update the path in our file sink to write to a file in the `/dev` directory, which is already writable:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway-proxy
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  bindAddress: '::'
  bindPort: 8080
  proxyNames:
    - gateway-proxy
  httpGateway: {}
  useProxyProto: false
  options:
    accessLoggingService:
      accessLog:
        - fileSink:
            path: /dev/access-logs.json
            jsonFormat:
              protocol: "%PROTOCOL%"
              duration: "%DURATION%"
              upstreamCluster: "%UPSTREAM_CLUSTER%"
              upstreamHost: "%UPSTREAM_HOST%"
```

This will cause requests to the HTTP port to be logged to a file inside the `gateway-proxy` container:
```
$ kubectl exec -n gloo-system -it deploy/gateway-proxy -- cat /dev/access-logs.json
```

```
{"duration":"4","upstreamCluster":"default-petstore-8080_gloo-system","protocol":"HTTP/1.1","upstreamHost":"10.52.0.54:8080"}
{"upstreamCluster":"default-petstore-8080_gloo-system","protocol":"HTTP/1.1","upstreamHost":"10.52.0.54:8080","duration":"1"}
{"upstreamCluster":"default-petstore-8080_gloo-system","protocol":"HTTP/1.1","upstreamHost":"10.52.0.54:8080","duration":"1"}
```

## gRPC Access Logging

The previous section reviewed the different ways you can configure access logging to output to a file local to the 
proxy container. Alternatively, it may be desirable to configure Envoy to emit access logs to a gRPC endpoint. This would be
a custom service deployed to your cluster that receives access log events and then does something with them - such 
as writing them to a file in the access log gRPC service container, or sending them to an enterprise logging backend.

### Deploying the open source gRPC access logger

Open source Gloo Gateway includes an optional gRPC access log server implementation that can be turned on and deployed using
the following helm values:

```yaml
# Note: for enterprise users, this should be prefixed with "gloo"
# gloo:
#   accessLogger:
#     enabled: true

accessLogger:
  enabled: true
```

This will add a deployment to the `gloo-system` namespace called `gateway-proxy-access-logger`. It also deploys a 
Kubernetes service, and adds the following static cluster to the `gateway-proxy-envoy-config` config map:

```yaml
...
      - name: access_log_cluster
        connect_timeout: 5.000s
        load_assignment:
            cluster_name: access_log_cluster
            endpoints:
            - lb_endpoints:
              - endpoint:
                    address:
                        socket_address:
                            address: gateway-proxy-access-logger.gloo-system.svc.cluster.local
                            port_value: 8083
        http2_protocol_options: {}
        type: STRICT_DNS # if .Values.accessLogger.enabled # if $spec.tracing
...
```

This access logging service can now be used by configuring the **gateway** CRD:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway-proxy
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  bindAddress: '::'
  bindPort: 8080
  httpGateway: {}
  proxyNames:
  - gateway-proxy
  useProxyProto: false
  options:
    accessLoggingService:
      accessLog:
        - grpcService:
            logName: example
            staticClusterName: access_log_cluster
```

{{% notice note %}}
You may want to add additional configuration for the {{% protobuf name="als.options.gloo.solo.io.GrpcService" display="GrpcService"%}} such as additional request headers to log so they can be accessed in the gRPC access logs.
{{% /notice %}}

This will cause requests to the HTTP port to be logged to standard out in the `gateway-proxy-access-logger` container:
```
$ kubectl logs -n gloo-system deploy/gateway-proxy-access-logger
```

```

The code for this server implementation is available [here](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/tree/main/projects/accesslogger). 

### Building a custom service

If you are building a custom access logging gRPC service, you will need get it deployed alongside Gloo Gateway. The Envoy
config (that Gloo Gateway stores in `gateway-proxy-envoy-config`) will need to include a new static cluster pointing to your 
custom access log server. Once you have a named static cluster in your envoy config, you can reference it in 
your **gateway** CRD. 

The Gloo Gateway access logger was written to be customizable with callbacks, so it may provide a useful starting
point. Feel free to open an issue in the Gloo Gateway repo to track improvements to the existing implementation. 

To verify your Envoy access logging configuration, use `glooctl check`. If there is a problem configuring the Envoy 
listener with your custom access logging server, it should be reported there. 

## OpenTelemetry Access Logging

Gloo Gateway also supports OpenTelemetry access logging. This feature is available in Gloo Gateway starting in `1.19.0`. 

### Configuring the OpenTelemetry access logger

This access logging service can now be used by configuring the **gateway** CRD:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway-proxy
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  bindAddress: '::'
  bindPort: 8080
  httpGateway: {}
  proxyNames:
  - gateway-proxy
  useProxyProto: false
  options:
    accessLoggingService:
      accessLog:
        - openTelemetryService:
            logName: example
            collector:
              endpoint: otel-collector.default.svc.cluster.local:4317
```

For more information and additional settings, see the [Access log API]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/options/als/als.proto.sk/#opentelemetryservice" >}}).


## Configuring multiple access logs 

More than one access log can be configured for a single Envoy listener. Putting the examples above together, here is a configuration
that includes four different access log outputs: a default string-formatted access log to standard out on the Envoy container, a default
string-formatted access log to a file in the Envoy container, a json-formatted access log to a different file in the Envoy container, 
and a json-formatted access log to standard out in the `gateway-proxy-access-logger` container. 

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: gateway-proxy
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  bindAddress: '::'
  bindPort: 8080
  httpGateway: {}
  proxyNames:
    - gateway-proxy
  useProxyProto: false
  options:
    accessLoggingService:
      accessLog:
        - fileSink:
            path: /dev/stdout
            stringFormat: ""
        - fileSink:
            path: /dev/default-access-log.txt
            stringFormat: ""
        - fileSink:
            path: /dev/other-access-log.json
            jsonFormat:
              protocol: "%PROTOCOL%"
              duration: "%DURATION%"
              upstreamCluster: "%UPSTREAM_CLUSTER%"
              upstreamHost: "%UPSTREAM_HOST%"
        - grpcService:
            logName: example
            staticClusterName: access_log_cluster
```

## Filtering access logs 

You can apply different filters on your access logs to reduce and optimize the number of logs that are stored. For example, you can filter access logs based on request headers, HTTP response codes, gRPC status codes, request duration, health check status, tracing parameters, response flags, and more. You can also combine multiple filters, and perform `AND` and `OR` operations on filter results. For more information, see {{% protobuf name="als.options.gloo.solo.io.AccessLogFilter" display="AccessLogFilter"%}}. 

### Using status code filters

You can apply access log filters to requests that match a specific HTTP status code by using the `defaultValue` and `runtimeKey` option. 

**Option 1: Use `defaultValue`** </br>

Use the `defaultValue` option in the Gateway resource to specify the HTTP status code for which you want to apply the access log filter. Note that the `defaultValue` is set for a specific Gateway only. To apply the same HTTP status code to multiple Gateway resources, see `Option 2: Override the default value with a runtime key-value pair`. 

1. Follow the steps in [File-based](#file-based-access-logging) or [gRPC](#grpc-access-logging) access logging to enable access logging for your gateway.
2. To apply additional filters to your access logs, you create or edit your gateway resource and add the access log filters to the `spec.options.accessLoggingService.accessLog` section. The following example uses file-based access logging and captures access logs only for requests with an HTTP response code that is greater than or equal to 400. Note that the `runtimeKey` overrides any settings in `defaultValue`, so in this example, the `runtimeKey` is also set to 400.
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
   kind: Gateway
   metadata:
     labels:
       app: gloo

**Option 2: Override the default value with a runtime key-value pair**: </br>

You can apply access log filters for requests that match an HTTP status code that you defined in the [Envoy runtime configuration layer](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.30.0/configuration/operations/runtime#config-runtime-bootstrap). This setup is useful if you have multiple gateway proxies that all share the same runtime configuration.

{{% notice note %}}
Note that the `runtimeKey` is enforced only if it matches a key that is defined in Envoy’s runtime configuration layer. Gloo Gateway does not include a key by default. If the key cannot be found in the Envoy runtime configuration, the `defaultValue` option is used to determine the HTTP status code for which to enforce the access log filter. 
{{% /notice %}}

1. Set a runtime value in the Envoy configuration layer for the status code that you want to apply the access log filter for. The runtime value is a key-value pair, such as `access_log_status_filter: 400`. Choose between the following options to set the runtime value:
   * Set the runtime value by using the `gatewayProxies.NAME.customStaticLayer` Helm value.
   * Set the runtime value by using the gateway proxy admin interface.

2. Follow the steps in [File-based](#file-based-access-logging) or [gRPC](#grpc-access-loggin) access logging to enable access logging for your gateway.
3. Create or edit your gateway resource and add the access log filters to the `spec.options.accessLoggingService.accessLog` section. The following example uses file-based access logging and captures access logs only for requests with an HTTP response code that is greater than or equal to what is defined in the `access_log_status_filter` runtime value.

   Note that the `runtimeKey` overrides any settings in `defaultValue`.

### Using header filters on access logs with prefix matching

You can apply access log filters to requests where the request path is rewritten to a different path before the request is forwarded to the upstream destination. 

Let's assume the following virtual service that rewrites request paths from `httpbin/get` to `/get` before the request is forwarded to the httpbin app. 

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
name: default
namespace: gloo-system
spec:
virtualHost:
  domains:
  - '*'
  routes:
  - matchers:
    - prefix: /httpbin/get
    options:
      prefixRewrite: /get
    routeAction:
      single:
        upstream:
          name: default-httpbin-8000
          namespace: gloo-system
```

For requests that are rewritten to a different path, the original path is stored in the `X-ENVOY-ORIGINAL-PATH` header. To filter access logs based on the original path, you can use the `headerFilter` access log filter option in the gateway resource. In the following example, the `X-ENVOY-ORIGINAL-PATH` header must be set to `/httpbin/get` (`prefixMatch`) for the filter to apply. Because `invertMatch: true` is set, only requests with an `X-ENVOY-ORIGINAL-PATH` header value that does not equal `/httpbin/get` are logged. 

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  labels:
    app: gloo
  name: gateway-proxy
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  bindAddress: '::'
  bindPort: 8080
  options:
    accessLoggingService:
      accessLog:
      - fileSink:
          jsonFormat:
            duration: '%DURATION%'
            origpath: '%REQ(X-ENVOY-ORIGINAL-PATH?:PATH)%'
            protocol: '%PROTOCOL%'
          path: /dev/stdout
        filter:
          headerFilter:
            header:
              invertMatch: true #requests NOT starting with /httpbin/get are logged
              name: X-ENVOY-ORIGINAL-PATH
              prefixMatch: /httpbin/get
  proxyNames:
  - gateway-proxy
  ssl: false
  useProxyProto: false
```

To log requests for the rewritten path only, you can set the `header.name` field to `:path` as shown in the following example. 

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  labels:
    app: gloo
  name: gateway-proxy
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  bindAddress: '::'
  bindPort: 8080
  options:
    accessLoggingService:
      accessLog:
      - fileSink:
          jsonFormat:
            duration: '%DURATION%'
            origpath: '%REQ(X-ENVOY-ORIGINAL-PATH?:PATH)%'
            protocol: '%PROTOCOL%'
          path: /dev/stdout
        filter:
          headerFilter:
            header:
              name: ":path"
              exactMatch: /get
  proxyNames:
  - gateway-proxy
  ssl: false
  useProxyProto: false
```
