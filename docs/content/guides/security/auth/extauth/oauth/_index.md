{{% /notice %}}

Gloo Gateway supports authentication via **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**. OIDC is an identity layer on top of the **OAuth 2.0** protocol. In OAuth 2.0 flows, authentication is performed by an external **Identity Provider** (IdP) which, in case of success, returns an **Access Token** representing the user identity. The protocol does not define the contents and structure of the Access Token, which greatly reduces the portability of OAuth 2.0 implementations.

The goal of OIDC is to address this ambiguity by additionally requiring Identity Providers to return a well-defined **ID Token**. OIDC ID tokens follow the [JSON Web Token]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/security/auth/jwt" %}}) standard and contain specific fields that your applications can expect and handle. This standardization allows you to switch between Identity Providers - or support multiple ones at the same time - with minimal, if any, changes to your downstream services; it also allows you to consistently apply additional security measures like _Role-based Access Control (RBAC)_ based on the identity of your users, i.e. the contents of their ID token (check out [this guide]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/security/auth/jwt/access_control" %}}) for an example of how to use Gloo Gateway to apply RBAC policies to JWTs). 

In this guide, we will focus on the format of the Gloo Gateway API for OIDC authentication.

{{% notice warning %}}
This feature requires Gloo Gateway's external auth server to communicate with an external OIDC provider/authorization server.
Because of this interaction, the OIDC flow may take longer than the default timeout of 200ms.
You can increase this timeout by setting the {{% protobuf name="enterprise.gloo.solo.io.Settings" display="`requestTimeout` value on external auth settings"%}}.
The external auth settings can be configured on the {{% protobuf name="gloo.solo.io.Settings" display="global Gloo Gateway `Settings` object"%}}.

## Configuration format
{{% notice warning %}}

Following is an example of an `AuthConfig` with an OIDC configuration (for more information on `AuthConfig` CRDs, see the [main page]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/security/auth/extauth/#auth-configuration-overview" >}}) 
of the authentication docs):

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=8-17" >}}
apiVersion: enterprise.gloo.solo.io/v1
kind: AuthConfig
metadata:
  name: oidc
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  configs:
  - oauth2:
      oidcAuthorizationCode:
        issuerUrl: theissuer.com
        appUrl: https://myapp.com
        authEndpointQueryParams:
          paramKey: paramValue
        callbackPath: /my/callback/path/
        clientId: myclientid
        clientSecretRef:
          name: my-oauth-secret
          namespace: gloo-system
        scopes:
        - email
{{< /highlight >}}

The `AuthConfig` consists of a single `config` of type `oauth`. Let's go through each of its attributes:

- `issuer_url`: The url of the OpenID Connect identity provider. Gloo Gateway will automatically discover OpenID Connect 
configuration by querying the `.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint on the `issuer_url`. For example, if you are 
using Google as an identity provider, Gloo Gateway will expect to find OIDC discovery information at 
`https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
- `auth_endpoint_query_params`: A map of query parameters appended to the issuer url in the form
 `issuer_url`?`paramKey`:`paramValue`. These query parameters are sent to the [authorization endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/oauth2#oauth-endpoints)
  when Gloo Gateway initiates the OIDC flow. This can be useful when integrating Gloo Gateway with some identity providers that require
  custom parameters to be sent to the authorization endpoint.
- `app_url`: This is the public URL of your application. It is used in combination with the `callback_path` attribute.
- `callback_path`: The callback path relative to the `app_url`. Once a user has been authenticated, the identity provider 
will redirect them to this URL. Gloo Gateway will intercept requests with this path, exchange the authorization code received from 
the Identity Provider for an ID token, place the ID token in a cookie on the request, and forward the request to its original destination. 

{{% notice note %}}
The callback path must have a matching route in the VirtualService associated with the OIDC settings. For example, you could simply have a `/` path-prefix route which would match any callback path. The important part of this callback "catch all" route is that it goes through the routing filters including external auth. Please see the examples for Google, Dex, and Okta. 
{{% /notice %}}

- `client_id`: This is the **client id** that you obtained when you registered your application with the identity provider.
- `client_secret_ref`: This is a reference to a Kubernetes secret containing the **client secret** that you obtained 
when you registered your application with the identity provider. The easiest way to create the Kubernetes secret in the 
expected format is to use `glooctl`, but you can use `kubectl create secret` or `kubectl apply` as well. If you use `kubectl create secret`, be sure to annotate the secret with `*v1.Secret` so that Gloo Gateway detects the secret.

- `scopes`: scopes to request in addition to the `openid` scope.

## Cookie options

Use the cookieOptions field to customize cookie behavior:
- notSecure - Set the cookie to not secure. This is not recommended, but might be useful for demo/testing purposes.
- maxAge - The max age of the cookie in seconds.  Leave unset for a default of 30 days (2592000 seconds). To disable cookie expiry, set explicitly to 0.
- path - The path of the cookie.  If unset, it defaults to "/". Set it explicitly to "" to avoid setting a path.
- domain - The domain of the cookie.  The default value is empty and matches only the originating request.  This is fine for cases where the `VirtualService` matches the host value that is also the redirect target of the IdP.  However, this value is critical if the OAuth provider is redirecting the request to another subdomain, for example.  Consider a case where a `VirtualService` matches requests to `*.example.com` and the IdP redirects its auth requests to `subdomain.example.com`.  With default settings for `domain`, if a request comes in on `other.example.com`, the operation fails. The user is directed to the IdP login as expected but auth fails because the token-bearing cookie is not sent back to the proxy, since the request originates from a different subdomain.  However, if this `domain` property is set to `example.com`, then the operation succeeds because the cookie is sent to any subdomain of `example.com`.

Example configuration:

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=19-22" >}}
apiVersion: enterprise.gloo.solo.io/v1
kind: AuthConfig
metadata:
  name: oidc-dex
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  configs:
  - oauth2:
      oidcAuthorizationCode:
        appUrl: http://localhost:8080/
        callbackPath: /callback
        clientId: gloo
        clientSecretRef:
          name: oauth
          namespace: gloo-system
        issuerUrl: http://dex.gloo-system.svc.cluster.local:32000/
        scopes:
        - email
        session:
          cookieOptions:
            notSecure: true
            maxAge: 3600
{{< /highlight >}}
## Logout URL

Gloo also supports specifying a logout url. When specified, accessing this url will
trigger a deletion of the user session and revoke the user's access token. This action returns with an empty 200 HTTP response.

Example configuration:

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=19" >}}
apiVersion: enterprise.gloo.solo.io/v1
kind: AuthConfig
metadata:
  name: oidc-dex
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  configs:
  - oauth2:
      oidcAuthorizationCode:
        appUrl: http://localhost:8080/
        callbackPath: /callback
        clientId: gloo
        clientSecretRef:
          name: oauth
          namespace: gloo-system
        issuerUrl: http://dex.gloo-system.svc.cluster.local:32000/
        scopes:
        - email
        logoutPath: /logout
{{< /highlight >}}

When this URL is accessed, the user session and cookie are deleted. 
The access token on the server is also revoked based on the discovered revocation endpoint. 
You can also override the revocation endpoint through the [DiscoveryOverride field]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/enterprise/options/extauth/v1/extauth.proto.sk/#discoveryoverride" >}}) in `AuthConfig`.

{{% notice warning %}}
If the authorization server has a service error, Gloo logs out the user, but does not retry revoking the access token. Check the logs and your identity provider for errors, and manually revoke the access token.
{{% /notice %}}

### Front Channel Logout

Gloo also supports Front Channel Logout [RFC](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-frontchannel-1_0-final.html). Front channel logout is used when the OpenId provider is handling multiple logged in sessions and the logout endpoint should log out of all of them. The endpoint defined in `frontChannelLogout.path`
is registered with the OP and is called for each application when the user goes to the `logoutPath` endpoint. Like `logoutPath`, `frontChannelLogout.path` is a relative URL. 

The following diagram shows how the logout and front channel logout paths work together. The `logoutPath` initiates the logout. The `frontChannelLogout.path` handles the per-session deletion of the user session and cookie, and revokes the access token.

![Front Channel Logout Flow]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/img/front-channel-logout.png" %}})

Example configuration:
{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=20-21" >}}
apiVersion: enterprise.gloo.solo.io/v1
kind: AuthConfig
metadata:
  name: oidc-dex
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  configs:
  - oauth2:
      oidcAuthorizationCode:
        appUrl: http://localhost:8080/
        callbackPath: /callback
        clientId: gloo
        clientSecretRef:
          name: oauth
          namespace: gloo-system
        issuerUrl: http://dex.gloo-system.svc.cluster.local:32000/
        scopes:
        - email
        logoutPath: /logout
        frontChannelLogout:
          path: /front_channel_logout
{{< /highlight >}}




## Sessions in Cookies

You can store the ID token, access token, and other tokens that are returned from your OIDC provider in a cookie on the client side. To do this, you configure your cookie options, such as the `keyPrefix` that you want to add to the token name, in the `oauth2.oidcAuthorizationCode.session.cookie` section of your authconfig as shown in the following example. After a client successfully authenticates with the OIDC provider, the tokens are stored in the `Set-Cookie` response header and sent to the client. If you set a `keyPrefix` value in your cookie configuration, the prefix is added to the name of the token before it is sent to the client, such as `Set-Cookie: <myprefix>_id-token=<ID_token>`. To prove successful authentication with the OIDC provider in subsequent requests, clients send their tokens in a `Cookie` header. 

Cookie headers can have a maximum size of 4KB. If you find that your cookie header exceeds this value, you can either limit the size of the cookie header or [store the tokens in Redis](#sessions-in-redis) and send back a Redis session ID instead. 

{{% notice warning %}}
Storing the raw, unencrypted tokens in a cookie header is not a recommended security practice as they can be manipulated through malicious attacks. To encrypt your tokens, see [Symmetric cookie encryption](#symmetric-cookie-encryption). For a more secure setup, [store the tokens in a Redis instance](#sessions-in-redis) and send back a Redis session ID in the cookie header.

Example configuration:
{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=19-21" >}}
apiVersion: enterprise.gloo.solo.io/v1
kind: AuthConfig
metadata:
  name: oidc-dex
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  configs:
  - oauth2:
      oidcAuthorizationCode:
        appUrl: http://localhost:8080/
        callbackPath: /callback
        clientId: gloo
        clientSecretRef:
          name: oauth
          namespace: gloo-system
        issuerUrl: http://dex.gloo-system.svc.cluster.local:32000/
        scopes:
        - email
        session:
          cookie:
            keyPrefix: "my_cookie_prefix"
{{< /highlight >}}

### Symmetric cookie encryption

By default, the tokens that are sent in the cookie header are not encrypted and can be manipulated through malicious attacks. To encrypt the cookie values, you can add a `cipherConfig` section to your session configuration as shown in the following example. 

{{% notice note %}}
Setting the `cipherConfig` attribute is supported in Gloo Gateway version 1.15 and later and can be used only to encrypt cookie sessions. You cannot use this feature to encrypt Redis sessions. 
{{% /notice %}}

1. Create a secret with your encryption key. Note that the key must be 32 bytes in length. 
   ```shell
   glooctl create secret encryptionkey --name my-encryption-key --key "an example of an encryption key1"
   ```

2. Reference the secret in the `cipherConfig` section of your authconfig. 
   {{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=8-11" >}}
   ...
   kind: AuthConfig
   spec:
     configs:
     - oauth2:
          oidcAuthorizationCode:
            session:
              cipherConfig:
                keyRef:
                  name: my-encryption-key
                  namespace: gloo-system
                cookie:
                  keyPrefix: "my_cookie_prefix"
   {{< /highlight >}}

## Sessions in Redis

By default, the tokens will be saved in a secure client side cookie.
Gloo can instead use Redis to save the OIDC tokens, and set a randomly generated session id in the user's cookie.
Going forward in the Gloo Gateway documentation, we will be using examples of OIDC using a redis session.

Example configuration:

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=19-25" >}}
apiVersion: enterprise.gloo.solo.io/v1
kind: AuthConfig
metadata:
  name: oidc-dex
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  configs:
  - oauth2:
      oidcAuthorizationCode:
        appUrl: http://localhost:8080/
        callbackPath: /callback
        clientId: gloo
        clientSecretRef:
          name: oauth
          namespace: gloo-system
        issuerUrl: http://dex.gloo-system.svc.cluster.local:32000/
        scopes:
        - email
        session:
          failOnFetchFailure: true
          redis:
            cookieName: session
            options:
              host: redis.gloo-system.svc.cluster.local:6379
{{< /highlight >}}

## Forwarding the ID token upstream

You can configure gloo to forward the id token to the upstream on successful authentication. To do that,
set the headers section in the configuration.

Example configuration:

{{< highlight yaml "hl_lines=19-21" >}}
apiVersion: enterprise.gloo.solo.io/v1
kind: AuthConfig
metadata:
  name: oidc-dex
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  configs:
  - oauth2:
      oidcAuthorizationCode:
        appUrl: http://localhost:8080/
        callbackPath: /callback
        clientId: gloo
        clientSecretRef:
          name: oauth
          namespace: gloo-system
        issuerUrl: http://dex.gloo-system.svc.cluster.local:32000/
        scopes:
        - email
        headers:
          idTokenHeader: "x-token"
{{< /highlight >}}

## Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) for public and untrusted clients

In a traditional OAuth Authorization flow, the client sends a client secret to the authorization server to request an access token. Depending on the type of client that you use, the client secret might be shared across users and devices. Public clients, such as a mobile app, cannot securely store the client secret as it is embedded in the web browser or can be retrieved by decompiling the app. To avoid authorization code injection attacks, you can leverage the Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) OAuth extension. 

PKCE builds on top of the OAuth2 protocol. Instead of sending a client secret to the authorization server, the client generates a random value that is called the Code Verifier and hashes the Code Verifier to create the Code Challenge. The Code Challenge is sent to the authorization server where it is stored for later verification. At the same time, the authorization server returns an authorization code that is good for one use. To request an access token, the client now sends the authorization code and the Code Verifier that was generated earlier. The authorization server hashes the Code Verifier and compares the result to the Code Challenge that the client sent earlier. If both values match, the client is authorized and an access token is returned. 

With Gloo Gateway, you can implement PKCE-secured OAuth flows by leveraging the `authEndpointQueryParams` and `tokenEndpointQueryParams` fields in the AuthConfig. For example, to send the code challenge, add the `code_challenge` query parameter to the `authEndpointQueryParams` field. To request an access token, include the `code` and `code_verifier` in the `tokenEndpointQueryParams` field. 

{{% notice note %}}
PKCE-secured OAuth flows can be configured for all supported OIDC providers, except for Okta. Support for the Okta OIDC provider is planned to be added in Gloo Gateway Enterprise version 1.15.0.
