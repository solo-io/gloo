## Plugins

Gloo Gateway invites developers to extend Gloo Gateway's functionality and adapt to new use cases via the addition of plugins. 

Gloo Gateway's plugin based architecture makes it easy to extend functionality in a variety of areas:

- [Gloo Gateway's API](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/tree/main/projects/gloo/api/v1): You can extend the API by using [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) along with [Solo-Kit](https://github.com/solo-io/solo-kit).
- [Service discovery plugins](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/blob/main/projects/gloo/pkg/discovery/discovery.go#L21): Automatically discover service endpoints from catalogs such as [Kubernetes](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/tree/main/projects/gloo/pkg/plugins/kubernetes) and [Consul](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/tree/main/projects/gloo/pkg/plugins/consul).
- [Function discovery plugins](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/blob/main/projects/discovery/pkg/fds/interface.go#L31): Discover and automatically annotate services with discovered service information, such as OpenAPI endpoints and gRPC methods.
- [Routing plugins](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/blob/main/projects/gloo/pkg/plugins/plugin_interface.go#L53): Customize the routing decisions for requests that match a particular route or virtual host. 
- [Upstream plugins](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/tree/main/projects/gloo/pkg/plugins): Customize the routing rules for requests to a particular service.
