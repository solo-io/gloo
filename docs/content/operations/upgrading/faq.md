Before you upgrade Gloo Gateway, complete the following preparatory steps:
* [Prepare your environment](#prepare), such as upgrading your current version to the latest patch and upgrading any dependencies to the required supported versions. 
* [Review important changes](#review-changes) made to Gloo Gateway in version {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest_minor.md" markdown="true">}}, including CRD, Helm, CLI, and feature changes.
* [Review frequently-asked questions](#faqs) about the upgrade process.

## Prepare your environment {#prepare}

Review the following preparatory steps that might be required for your environment.

### Upgrade your current minor version to the latest patch {#current-patch}

Before you upgrade your minor version, first upgrade your current version to the latest patch. For example, if you currently run Gloo Gateway Enterprise version {{< readfile file="static/content/version_gee_n-1_oldpatch.md" markdown="true">}}, first upgrade your installation to version {{< readfile file="static/content/version_gee_n-1.md" markdown="true">}}. This ensures that your current environment is up-to-date with any bug fixes or security patches before you begin the minor version upgrade process.

1. Find the latest patch of your minor version by checking the [Open Source changelog]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/changelog/open_source/" %}}) or [Enterprise changelog]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/changelog/enterprise/" %}}).
2. Go to the documentation set for your current minor version. For example, if you currently run Gloo Gateway Enterprise version {{< readfile file="static/content/version_gee_n-1_oldpatch.md" markdown="true">}}, use the drop-down menu in the header of this page to select **v{{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_n-1_minor.md" markdown="true">}}.x**.
3. Follow the upgrade guide, using the latest patch for your minor version.

### If required, perform incremental minor version updates {#minor-increment}

If you plan to upgrade to a version that is more than one minor version greater than your current version, such as to version {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest_minor.md" markdown="true">}} from {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_n-2_minor.md" markdown="true">}} or older, you must upgrade incrementally. For example, you must first use the upgrade guide in the v{{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_n-1_minor.md" markdown="true">}}.x documentation set to upgrade from {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_n-2_minor.md" markdown="true">}} to {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_n-1_minor.md" markdown="true">}}, and then follow the upgrade guide in the v{{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest_minor.md" markdown="true">}}.x documentation set to upgrade from {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_n-1_minor.md" markdown="true">}} to {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest_minor.md" markdown="true">}}.

### Upgrade dependencies {#dependencies}

Check that your underlying infrastructure platform, such as Kubernetes, and other dependencies run a version that is supported for {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest_minor.md" markdown="true">}}.

1. Review the [supported versions]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/support/#supported-versions" %}}) for dependencies such as Kubernetes, Istio, Helm, and more.
2. Compare the supported versions against the versions you currently use.
3. If necessary, upgrade your dependencies, such as consulting your cluster infrastructure provider to upgrade the version of Kubernetes that your cluster runs.

### Consider settings to avoid downtime {#downtime}

You might deploy Gloo Gateway in Kubernetes environments that use the Kubernetes load balancer, or in non-Kubernetes environments. Depending on your setup, you can take additional steps to avoid downtime during the upgrade process.

* **Kubernetes**: Enable [Envoy readiness and liveness probes]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/production_deployment/#enable-health-checks" >}}) during the upgrade. When these probes are set, Kubernetes sends requests only to the healthy Envoy proxy during the upgrade process, which helps to prevent potential downtime. The probes are not enabled in default installations because they can lead to timeouts or other poor getting started experiences. 
* **Non-Kubernetes**: Configure [health checks]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/traffic_management/request_processing/health_checks" >}}) on Envoy. Then, configure your load balancer to leverage these health checks, so that requests stop going to Envoy when it begins draining connections.

## Review version {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest_minor.md" markdown="true">}} changes {#review-changes}

Review the following changes made to Gloo Gateway in version {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest_minor.md" markdown="true">}}. For some changes, you might be required to complete additional steps during the upgrade process.

### Breaking changes

Review the breaking changes in this release. 

##### Envoy version upgrade

The Envoy dependency in Gloo Gateway 1.22 was upgraded from 1.36.x to 1.38.x. This change includes the following upstream breaking changes. For more information about these changes, see the changelog documentation for [Envoy v1.37](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/version_history/v1.37/v1.37) and [Envoy v1.38](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/version_history/v1.38/v1.38).

**Envoy v1.38**:

* tls: Set [enforce_rsa_key_usage](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.38.0/api-v3/extensions/transport_sockets/tls/v3/tls.proto.html#envoy-v3-api-field-extensions-transport-sockets-tls-v3-upstreamtlscontext-enforce-rsa-key-usage) to true by default. The handshake will fail if the keyUsage extension is present and incompatible with the TLS usage. In the next version of Envoy, this option will be removed and the enforcing behavior will always be used. 
NOTE: This is specific to envoy's upstream tls connections, the keyUsage extension tells consumers what the certificate’s public key is allowed to be used for. If the keyUsage extension is present but does not match the TLS role, the handshake of the upstream connection will fail. While envoy allows this to set back to false, we don't expose this setting in our BackendConfigPolicy. For RSA certificates, common bits include:

  * digitalSignature
  * keyEncipherment
  * keyCertSign for CA certs
  * cRLSign for CA certs that sign revocation lists

* rbac: Fixed RBAC header matcher to validate each header value individually instead of concatenating multiple header values into a single string. This prevents potential bypasses when requests contain multiple values for the same header. The new behavior is enabled by the runtime guard envoy.reloadable_features.rbac_match_headers_individually.

##### XSLT transformation removed

The XSLT transformation feature (Enterprise) was deprecated in Gloo Gateway v1.21.0 and is now removed in v1.22.0. If you use XSLT transformations, plan to use an external processing server to process this type of transformation. For more information, see [External processing]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/traffic_management/extproc/" %}}).  

## New features

The following features were introduced in envoy. 

**Envoy v1.37**:

* Added container-aware CPU detection on Linux that respects cgroup CPU limits alongside hardware thread count and CPU affinity when --concurrency is not set. Envoy now uses the minimum of hardware threads, CPU affinity, and cgroup CPU limits to size worker threads by default, improving resource utilization in cgroup-limited containers. This behavior can be disabled by setting ENVOY_CGROUP_CPU_DETECTION to false to restore the previous hardware thread and affinity-based sizing. Uses conservative floor rounding to leave capacity for non-worker threads, which may reduce the total number of connections.

**Envoy v1.38**:

* conn_pool: Added new upstream_rq_active_overflow counter incremented when a request is rejected due to the max_requests circuit breaker being exhausted in attachStreamToClient(). Previously this condition incorrectly incremented upstream_rq_pending_overflow, making it impossible to distinguish pending queue saturation from active request saturation via metrics alone. The new counter is now the authoritative signal for this path by default; set runtime flag envoy.reloadable_features.skip_pending_overflow_count_on_active_rq to false to also increment upstream_rq_pending_overflow on this path, preserving backwards compatibility with existing dashboards and alerts.
NOTE: upstream_rq_pending_overflow might drop lower after upgrade
* memory: Replaced the custom timer-based tcmalloc memory release with tcmalloc’s native ProcessBackgroundActions and SetBackgroundReleaseRate APIs. This provides more comprehensive background memory management including per-CPU cache reclamation, cache shuffling, and size class resizing, in addition to memory release. The tcmalloc.released_by_timer stat has been removed.

### Changelogs

Check the changelogs for the type of Gloo Gateway deployment that you have. Focus especially on any **Breaking Changes** that might require a different upgrade procedure. For Gloo Gateway Enterprise, you might also review the open source changelogs because most of the proto definitions are open source.
* [Open Source changelogs]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/changelog/open_source/" %}})
* [Enterprise changelogs]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/changelog/enterprise/" %}}): Keep in mind that Gloo Gateway Enterprise pulls in Gloo Gateway Open Source as a dependency. Although the major and minor version numbers are the same for open source and enterprise, their patch versions often differ. For example, open source might use version `x.y.a` but enterprise uses version `x.y.b`. If you are unfamiliar with these versioning concepts, see [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Because of the differing patch versions, you might notice different output when checking your version with `glooctl version`. For example, your API server might run Gloo Gateway Enterprise version {{< readfile file="static/content/version_gee_latest.md" markdown="true">}}, which pulls in Gloo Gateway Open Source version {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest.md" markdown="true">}} as a dependency.
  ```bash
  ~ > glooctl version
  Client: {"version":"{{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest.md" markdown="true">}}"}
  Server: {"type":"Gateway","enterprise":true,"kubernetes":...,{"Tag":"{{< readfile file="static/content/version_gee_latest.md" markdown="true">}}","Name":"grpcserver-ee","Registry":"quay.io/solo-io"},...,{"Tag":"{{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest.md" markdown="true">}}","Name":"discovery","Registry":"quay.io/solo-io"},...}
  ```

### Feature changes {#features}

No feature changes are reported. 
<!--
### CRD changes {#crd}

New CRDs are automatically applied to your cluster when performing a `helm install` operation, but are _not_ applied when performing an `helm upgrade` operation. This is a [deliberate design choice](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#limitations-on-crds) on the part of the Helm maintainers, given the risk associated with changing CRDs. Given this limitation, you must apply new CRDs to the cluster before upgrading. 

Review the following summary of important new, deprecated, or removed CRD updates. For full details, see the [changelogs](#changelogs).

As part of the {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest.md" markdown="true">}} release, no CRD changes were introduced.

**New and updated CRDs**:


**Deprecated CRDs**:
N/A

**Removed CRDs**:
N/A

### CLI changes {#cli}

You must upgrade `glooctl` before you upgrade Gloo Gateway. Because `glooctl` can create resources in your cluster, such as with `glooctl add route`, you might have errors in Gloo Gateway if you create resources with an older version of `glooctl`.

Review the following summary of important new, deprecated, or removed CLI options. For full details, see the [changelogs](#changelogs).

## Frequently-asked questions {#faqs}

Review the following frequently-asked questions about the upgrade process. If you still aren't sure about the version upgrade impact, or if your use case doesn't quite fit the standard upgrade path, feel free to post in the `#gloo` or `#gloo-enterprise` channels of our [public Slack](https://slack.solo.io/).

### How do I upgrade Gloo Gateway in testing or sandbox environments?

If downtime is not a concern for your use case, you can follow the [Quick upgrade guide]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/upgrade_steps" >}}) to update your Gloo Gateway installation.

Note that for sandbox or exploratory environments, the easiest way to upgrade is to uninstall Gloo Gateway by running `glooctl uninstall --all`. Then, re-install Gloo Gateway at the desired version by the following one of the [installation guides]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/installation" >}}).
 
### How do I upgrade Gloo Gateway in a production environment, where downtime is unacceptable?

The basic `helm upgrade` process is not suitable for environments in which downtime is unacceptable. Instead, you can follow the [Canary upgrade]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/canary/" %}}) guide to deploy multiple version of Gloo Gateway to your cluster, and test the upgrade version before uninstalling the existing version.

Additionally, you might need to take steps to account for other factors such as Gloo Gateway version changes, probe configurations, and external infrastructure like the load balancer that Gloo Gateway uses. Consider setting up [liveness probes and healthchecks](#downtime) in your environment.

### What happens to my Gloo Gateway CRs during an upgrade? How do I handle breaking changes?

A typical upgrade of Gloo Gateway across minor versions should not cause disruptions to the existing Gloo Gateway state. In the case of a breaking change, Solo will communicate through the upgrade guides, changelogs, or other channels if you must make a specific adjustment to perform the upgrade. Note that you can always use the `glooctl debug yaml` command to download the current Gloo Gateway state to one large YAML manifest.

### Is the upgrade procedure different if I am not a cluster administrator?

If you are not an administrator of your cluster, you might be unable to create custom resource definitions (CRDs) and other cluster-scoped resources, such as cluster roles and cluster role bindings. If you encounter an error related to these resources, you can disable their creation by including the following setting in your Helm values:
```yaml
global:
  glooRbac:
    create: false
```

Otherwise, you can try performing an installation of Gloo Gateway that is scoped to a single namespace by including the following setting in your Helm values:
```yaml
global:
  glooRbac:
    namespaced: true
```

### Why do I get an error about re-creating CRDs when upgrading using `helm install` or `helm upgrade`?

Helm v2 does not manage CRDs well, and is not supported in Gloo Gateway. Upgrade to Helm v3, delete the CRDs, and try again.

### Why do I get an error about a `gateway-certgen` job?

The upgrade creates a Kubernetes Job named `gateway-certgen` to generate a certificate for the validation webhook. The job contains the `ttlSecondsAfterFinished` value so that the cluster cleans up the job automatically, but because this setting is still in Alpha, your cluster might ignore this value. In this case, you might have an issue while upgrading in which the upgrade attempts to change the `gateway-certgen` job, but the change fails because the job is immutable. To fix this issue, you can delete the job, which already completed, and re-apply the upgrade.
