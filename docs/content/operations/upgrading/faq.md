---

Before you upgrade Gloo Edge, complete the following preparatory steps:
* [Prepare your environment](#prepare), such as upgrading your current version to the latest patch and upgrading any dependencies to the required supported versions.
* [Review important changes](#review-changes) made to Gloo Edge in version {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest_minor.md" markdown="true">}}, including CRD, Helm, CLI, and feature changes.
* [Review frequently-asked questions](#faqs) about the upgrade process.

## Prepare your environment {#prepare}

Review the following preparatory steps that might be required for your environment.

### Upgrade your current minor version to the latest patch {#current-patch}

Before you upgrade your minor version, first upgrade your current version to the latest patch. For example, if you currently run Gloo Edge Enterprise version {{< readfile file="static/content/version_gee_n-1_oldpatch.md" markdown="true">}}, first upgrade your installation to version {{< readfile file="static/content/version_gee_n-1.md" markdown="true">}}. This ensures that your current environment is up-to-date with any bug fixes or security patches before you begin the minor version upgrade process.

1. Find the latest patch of your minor version by checking the [Open Source changelog]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/changelog/open_source/" %}}) or [Enterprise changelog]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/changelog/enterprise/" %}}).
2. Go to the documentation set for your current minor version. For example, if you currently run Gloo Edge Enterprise version {{< readfile file="static/content/version_gee_n-1_oldpatch.md" markdown="true">}}, use the drop-down menu in the header of this page to select **v{{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_n-1_minor.md" markdown="true">}}.x**.
3. Follow the upgrade guide, using the latest patch for your minor version.

### If required, perform incremental minor version updates {#minor-increment}

If you plan to upgrade to a version that is more than one minor version greater than your current version, such as to version {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest_minor.md" markdown="true">}} from {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_n-2_minor.md" markdown="true">}} or older, you must upgrade incrementally. For example, you must first use the upgrade guide in the v{{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_n-1_minor.md" markdown="true">}}.x documentation set to upgrade from {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_n-2_minor.md" markdown="true">}} to {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_n-1_minor.md" markdown="true">}}, and then follow the upgrade guide in the v{{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest_minor.md" markdown="true">}}.x documentation set to upgrade from {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_n-1_minor.md" markdown="true">}} to {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest_minor.md" markdown="true">}}.

### Upgrade dependencies {#dependencies}

Check that your underlying infrastructure platform, such as Kubernetes, and other dependencies run a version that is supported for {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest_minor.md" markdown="true">}}.

1. Review the [supported versions]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/support/#supported-versions" %}}) for dependencies such as Kubernetes, Helm, and more.
2. Compare the supported versions against the versions you currently use.
3. If necessary, upgrade your dependencies, such as consulting your cluster infrastructure provider to upgrade the version of Kubernetes that your cluster runs.

### Consider settings to avoid downtime {#downtime}

You might deploy Gloo Edge in Kubernetes environments that use the Kubernetes load balancer, or in non-Kubernetes environments. Depending on your setup, you can take additional steps to avoid downtime during the upgrade process.

* **Kubernetes**: Enable [Envoy readiness and liveness probes]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/production_deployment/#enable-health-checks" >}}) during the upgrade. When these probes are set, Kubernetes sends requests only to the healthy Envoy proxy during the upgrade process, which helps to prevent potential downtime. The probes are not enabled in default installations because they can lead to timeouts or other poor getting started experiences. 
* **Non-Kubernetes**: Configure [health checks]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/traffic_management/request_processing/health_checks" >}}) on Envoy. Then, configure your load balancer to leverage these health checks, so that requests stop going to Envoy when it begins draining connections.

## Review version {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest_minor.md" markdown="true">}} changes {#review-changes}

Review the following changes made to Gloo Edge in version {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest_minor.md" markdown="true">}}. For some changes, you might be required to complete additional steps during the upgrade process.

### Changelogs

Check the changelogs for the type of Gloo Edge deployment that you have. Focus especially on any **Breaking Changes** that might require a different upgrade procedure. For Gloo Edge Enterprise, you might also review the open source changelogs because most of the proto definitions are open source.
* [Open Source changelogs]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/changelog/open_source/" %}})
* [Enterprise changelogs]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/changelog/enterprise/" %}}): Keep in mind that Gloo Edge Enterprise pulls in Gloo Edge Open Source as a dependency. Although the major and minor version numbers are the same for open source and enterprise, their patch versions often differ. For example, open source might use version `x.y.a` but enterprise uses version `x.y.b`. If you are unfamiliar with these versioning concepts, see [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Because of the differing patch versions, you might notice different output when checking your version with `glooctl version`. For example, your API server might run Gloo Edge Enterprise version {{< readfile file="static/content/version_gee_latest.md" markdown="true">}}, which pulls in Gloo Edge Open Source version {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest.md" markdown="true">}} as a dependency.
  ```bash
  ~ > glooctl version
  Client: {"version":"{{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest.md" markdown="true">}}"}
  Server: {"type":"Gateway","enterprise":true,"kubernetes":...,{"Tag":"{{< readfile file="static/content/version_gee_latest.md" markdown="true">}}","Name":"grpcserver-ee","Registry":"quay.io/solo-io"},...,{"Tag":"{{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest.md" markdown="true">}}","Name":"discovery","Registry":"quay.io/solo-io"},...}
  ```

{{% notice tip %}}
You can use the changelogs' built-in [comparison tool]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/changelog/open_source/#compareversions" >}}) to compare between your current version and the version that you want to upgrade to.

### Feature changes {#features}
Review the following summary of important new, deprecated, or removed features. For full details, see the [changelogs](#changelogs). 

**New or improved features**:

* **Access log flushing**: You can now flush the access log on a periodic basis by setting the [`tcpProxySettings.accessLogFlushInterval` field in the `tcp` CRD]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/options/tcp/tcp.proto.sk/#tcpproxysettings" %}}). The default behavior is to write to the access log only when a connection is closed. For long-running TCP connections, this process can take a long time. If you flush periodically, you ensure that access logs can be written on a regular interval.
* **Debug logging on transformations**: If you apply transformations in your `VirtualService` resources, you can now [enable debug logging with the `logRequestResponseInfo` field]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/traffic_management/request_processing/transformations/debug_logging/" %}}).
* **Inja 3.4**: Inja version 3.4 provides access to numerous new templating features for your [transformations]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/traffic_management/request_processing/transformations/" %}}).
* **Kubernetes 1.26 and 1.27**: Gloo Edge version 1.15 is now supported on clusters that run Kubernetes version 1.26 and 1.27.
* **Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) stapling**: If you use servers with OCSP stapling, and fetch or pre-fetch OCSP responses for server domains from OCSP responders, you can now provide an OCSP staple policy for a listener in the [`ocspStaplePolicy` field of the `ssl` CRD]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/ssl/ssl.proto.sk/#ocspstaplepolicy" %}}). You can store OCSP responses in TLS secrets either by using the [`glooctl create secret tls` command]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/cli/glooctl_create_secret_tls/" %}}) or by manually storing the OCSP response in the [`tls.ocsp-staple` field of the `secret` CRD]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/secret.proto.sk/" %}}).
* **Proxy protocol support for upstreams**: You can now set the [`proxyProtocolVersion` field in your `upstream` Gloo resource]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/upstream.proto.sk/" %}}).
* **Redis databases** (Enterprise only): When you use a Redis solution other than the default deployment installed by Gloo, you can specify a database other than `0` by setting the `redis.service.db` field. Note that this field is ignored for clustered Redis or when `ClientSideShardingEnabled` is set to true.
* **Symmetric encryption**: In the [`UserSession` section of the `ExtAuthConfig` resource]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/enterprise/options/extauth/v1/extauth.proto.sk/#usersession" %}}), you can now apply symmetric encryption to cookie session tokens and values by using the `cipherConfig` field.
* **Timeouts for GraphQL resolutions** (Enterprise only): In the `GraphQLApi` resource, you can now define a [`timeout` for the REST or gRPC resolver]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/enterprise/options/graphql/v1beta1/graphql.proto.sk/#restresolver" %}}).
* **Upgraded Envoy version dependency**: The Envoy dependency in Gloo Edge {{< readfile file="static/content/version_geoss_latest_minor.md" markdown="true">}} was upgraded from 1.25.x to 1.26.x. This upgrade includes the following changes. For more information about these changes, see the [Envoy changelog documentation](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/version_history/v1.26/v1.26.0).
  * **New header validation**: Envoy now validates header names and values before a request is forwarded to the upstream. Header validations are performed after transformation filters are applied to the request. If you use transformation policies to alter header names or values, and an incorrect format is introduced by this transformation, your request might not be forwarded to the upstream. To temporarily revert this change, you can set the `envoy.reloadable_features.validate_upstream_headers` runtime flag to false. For more information about the header manipulation, see the [Envoy documentation](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/http/header_validators/envoy_default/v3/header_validator.proto.html).
  * **Bugfix for `x-envoy-original-path` header**: Envoy fixed a bug where the internal `x-envoy-original-path` header was not removed when being sent from untrusted clients. This bugfix is crucial to prevent malicious actors from injecting this header to alter the behavior in Envoy. To temporarily revert this change, you can set the `envoy.reloadable_features.sanitize_original_path` runtime flag to false. 
  * **Sanitize non-UTF-8 header data**: Envoy now automatically sanitizes non-UTF-8 data and replaces it with a `!` character in gRPC service calls. This behavior fixes a bug where invalid protobuf messages were sent when non-UTF-8 HTTP header data was received. The receiving service typically generated an error when the protobuf message was decoded. This error message led to unintended behavior and other unforseen errors, such as a lack of visibility into requests as requests were not logged. By fixing this bug, Envoy now ensures that data in gRPC service calls is sent in valid UTF-8 format. To temporarily revert this change, you can set the `envoy.reloadable_features.service_sanitize_non_utf8_strings` runtime flag to false.

### Helm changes {#helm}

Review the following summary of important new, deprecated, or removed Helm fields. For full details, see the [changelogs](#changelogs).

**New and updated Helm fields**:

* `gateway.validation.webhook.skipDeleteValidationResources`: Skip using the validation webhook when you delete certain resources by specifying the resource types. This allows you to delete resources that were valid when created but are now invalid, such as short-lived upstreams.
* `global.extensions.extAuth.namedExtAuth.NAME.name and .namespace`: Specify [additional extauth servers]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/security/auth/multi_authz/#option-b---using-namedextauth" %}}).
* `gloo-fed`: The following fields are added to the `gloo-fed` section:
  * Custom securityContexts for pods: `gloo-fed.glooFed.podSecurityContext`
  * Custom securityContexts for deployments: `gloo-fed.glooFed.glooFed.securityContext`
  * Custom RBAC roles: `gloo-fed.glooFed.roleRules`
  * Volumes and volume mounts: `gloo-fed.glooFed.volumes` and `gloo-fed.glooFed.glooFed.volumeMounts`
* `gloo.headerSecretRefNsMatchesUs`: When set to true, any secrets that are sent in headers to upstreams via `headerSecretRefs` are required to come from the same namespace as the destination upstream.
* `gloo.settings.ratelimitServer`: Specify override settings for the rate limit server.
* `redis` (Enterprise only): The following fields are added to the `redis` section:
  * When you use a Redis solution other than the default deployment installed by Gloo, you can specify a database other than `0` by setting the `redis.service.db` field. Note that this is field is ignored for clustered Redis or when `ClientSideShardingEnabled` is set to true.
  * The `redis.tlsEnabled` field is added to enabled a Redis TLS connection for the rate limit server. The default value is false.
  * When you set both `redis.disabled` and `global.extensions.glooRedis.enableAcl` to true, a Redis secret is not created.
* `mergePolicy`: This field is added to any security context fields (such as `redis.deployment.initContainer.securityContext.mergePolicy`) to allow you to merge custom security context definitions with the default definition, instead of overwriting it.
* `settings.devMode`: In non-production environments, set to `true` to [enable a debug endpoint on the Gloo deployment on port 10010]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/debugging_gloo/#dev-mode-and-gloo-debug-endpoint" %}}).
* `settings.ratelimitServer`: Specify your [external rate limit server configuration]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/guides/security/rate_limiting/" %}}).

**Updated Helm fields**:
* `settings.regexMaxProgramSize`: The default value is changed to `1024`. Envoy has a default of 100, which is typically not large enough for regex patterns.
<!--**Deprecated Helm fields**:


**Removed Helm fields**:-->


### CRD changes {#crd}

New CRDs are automatically applied to your cluster when performing a `helm install` operation, but are _not_ applied when performing an `helm upgrade` operation. This is a [deliberate design choice](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#limitations-on-crds) on the part of the Helm maintainers, given the risk associated with changing CRDs. Given this limitation, you must apply new CRDs to the cluster before upgrading. 

Review the following summary of important new, deprecated, or removed CRD updates. For full details, see the [changelogs](#changelogs).

**New and updated CRDs**:

* `ExtAuthConfig`: In the [`UserSession` section]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/enterprise/options/extauth/v1/extauth.proto.sk/#usersession" %}}), you can now apply symmetric encryption to cookie session tokens and values by using the `cipherConfig` field.
* `Gateway`: You can now use the [`hybridGateway.delegatedTcpGateways` field]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gateway/api/v1/gateway.proto.sk/#hybridgateway" %}}) to configure multiple TCP gateways.
* `Gateway` (Enterprise only): You can now use the [`hybridGateway.matchedGateway.matcher.passthroughCipherSuites` field]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gateway/api/v1/gateway.proto.sk/#hybridgateway" %}}) to specify passthrough cipher suites.
* `GraphQLApi` (Enterprise only): You can now define a [`timeout` for the REST or gRPC resolver]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/enterprise/options/graphql/v1beta1/graphql.proto.sk/#restresolver" %}}).
* `hcm` and `options`: You can now set x-fowarded-host and x-forwarded-post headers by using the [`appendXForwardedPort` field in the `hcm` CRD]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/options/hcm/hcm.proto.sk/" %}}) and the `appendXForwardedHost` field in the [`options` CRD]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/options.proto.sk/" %}})

**Deprecated CRDs**:

* `ExtAuthConfig`: In the [`oidcAuthorizationCode` and `oauth2Config` sections]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/enterprise/options/extauth/v1/extauth.proto.sk/#oidcauthorizationcodeconfig" %}}), the `session` field is now deprecated. Use the `userSession` field instead.

<!--**Removed CRDs**:-->


### CLI changes {#cli}

You must upgrade `glooctl` before you upgrade Gloo Edge. Because `glooctl` can create resources in your cluster, such as with `glooctl add route`, you might have errors in Gloo Edge if you create resources with an older version of `glooctl`.

Review the following summary of important new, deprecated, or removed CLI options. For full details, see the [changelogs](#changelogs).

**New CLI commands or options**:

* `glooctl create secret encryptionkey`: [Create encryption secrets]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/reference/cli/glooctl_create_secret_encryptionkey/" %}}), such as to use in the `cipherConfig` field of the `ExtAuthConfig` resource.

<!--**Changed behavior**:-->



## Frequently-asked questions {#faqs}

Review the following frequently-asked questions about the upgrade process. If you still aren't sure about the version upgrade impact, or if your use case doesn't quite fit the standard upgrade path, feel free to post in the `#gloo` or `#gloo-enterprise` channels of our [public Slack](https://slack.solo.io/).

### How do I upgrade Gloo Edge in testing or sandbox environments?

If downtime is not a concern for your use case, you can follow the [Quick upgrade guide]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/upgrade_steps" >}}) to update your Gloo Edge installation.

Note that for sandbox or exploratory environments, the easiest way to upgrade is to uninstall Gloo Edge by running `glooctl uninstall --all`. Then, re-install Gloo Edge at the desired version by the following one of the [installation guides]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/installation" >}}).
 
### How do I upgrade Gloo Edge in a production environment, where downtime is unacceptable?

The basic `helm upgrade` process is not suitable for environments in which downtime is unacceptable. Instead, you can follow the [Canary upgrade]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/canary/" %}}) guide to deploy multiple version of Gloo Edge to your cluster, and test the upgrade version before uninstalling the existing version.

Additionally, you might need to take steps to account for other factors such as Gloo Edge version changes, probe configurations, and external infrastructure like the load balancer that Gloo Edge uses. Consider setting up [liveness probes and healthchecks](#downtime) in your environment.

### What happens to my Gloo Edge CRs during an upgrade? How do I handle breaking changes?

A typical upgrade of Gloo Edge across minor versions should not cause disruptions to the existing Gloo Edge state. In the case of a breaking change, Solo will communicate through the upgrade guides, changelogs, or other channels if you must make a specific adjustment to perform the upgrade. Note that you can always use the `glooctl debug yaml` command to download the current Gloo Edge state to one large YAML manifest.

### Is the upgrade procedure different if I am not a cluster administrator?

If you are not an administrator of your cluster, you might be unable to create custom resource definitions (CRDs) and other cluster-scoped resources, such as cluster roles and cluster role bindings. If you encounter an error related to these resources, you can disable their creation by including the following setting in your Helm values:
```yaml
global:
  glooRbac:
    create: false
```

Otherwise, you can try performing an installation of Gloo Edge that is scoped to a single namespace by including the following setting in your Helm values:
```yaml
global:
  glooRbac:
    namespaced: true
```

### Why do I get an error about re-creating CRDs when upgrading using `helm install` or `helm upgrade`?

Helm v2 does not manage CRDs well, and is not supported in Gloo Edge. Upgrade to Helm v3, delete the CRDs, and try again.

### Why do I get an error about a `gateway-certgen` job?

The upgrade creates a Kubernetes Job named `gateway-certgen` to generate a certificate for the validation webhook. The job contains the `ttlSecondsAfterFinished` value so that the cluster cleans up the job automatically, but because this setting is still in Alpha, your cluster might ignore this value. In this case, you might have an issue while upgrading in which the upgrade attempts to change the `gateway-certgen` job, but the change fails because the job is immutable. To fix this issue, you can delete the job, which already completed, and re-apply the upgrade.
