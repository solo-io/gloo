title: 1.7.0+ Upgrade Notice
weight: 60
description: Upgrading to Gloo Edge 1.7.x and Gloo Edge Enterprise 1.7.x
---

In this guide we will describe the necessary steps to upgrade your Gloo Edge or Gloo Edge Enterprise deployments to their `1.7`
versions using [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm). This guide also includes upgrade steps to Gloo Edge v1.6, as
that is required as an intermediate step for upgrading to v1.7 from earlier versions without downtime. This is because Gloo Edge v1.6
supports both v2 and v3 of Envoy's API in preparation of Envoy's plan to drop support for V2 in 1.18 (i.e., Gloo 1.7).
Gloo Edge v1.7 drops support for Envoy's v2 API, so upgrading Gloo Edge to v1.7 requires a pit stop upgrade at v1.6 to 
transition from Envoy v2 to v3 and maintain a continuous uptime.
 
The guide assumes that you are running Gloo Edge 1.5.0+ or Gloo Edge Enterprise 1.5.0+. 
If you need to upgrade from earlier versions, you should consider an intermediate upgrade to the 1.5 versions. 
In this case, please refer to the [1.5.0 upgrade guide]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/v1.5" >}})

This upgrade guide also assumes that was gloo installed via `helm` or with `glooctl` version 1.5.0+
(i.e., gloo is a helm release named "gloo", which you can confirm exists by running `helm ls --all-namespaces`).

Also, please make sure to check out our 
[general configuration recommendations]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/upgrade_steps#upgrading-the-server-components" >}}) 
to avoid downtime during upgrades.

### Breaking Changes

###### Open Source

1. in `glooctl`, the `--with-admin-console` flag was removed from installations, as the read-only UI as part of open
source has been removed, in favor of the multi-cluster UI that ships with enterprise.

2. the helm value `gatewayProxies.gatewayProxy.tracing.provider` is applied on the gateway instead of the gateway proxy
config map. Therefore, the value needs to be of type [v1.ListenerTracingSettings]({{% versioned_link_path fromRoot="reference/api/github.com/solo-io/gloo/projects/gloo/api/v1/options/tracing/tracing.proto.sk/#listenertracingsettings" %}}).

3. In v1.7.19 the `validationServerGrpcMaxSize` was replaced by `validationServerGrpcMaxSizeBytes` in the settings CRD.
If the new settings CRD is not applied, you will see the following type of error:
    * `Error: UPGRADE FAILED: error validating "": error validating data: ValidationError(Settings.spec.gateway.validation): unknown field "validationServerGrpcMaxSizeBytes" in io.solo.gloo.v1.Settings.spec.gateway.validation`
    * To apply the new settings CRD:
      ```
      helm pull gloo/gloo --version 1.7.19 --untar
      kubectl apply -f gloo/crds/gloo.solo.io_v1_Settings.yaml
      ```

###### Enterprise

1. The Gloo UI has been replaced by the Gloo-Fed UI, which is a multicluster version of the UI (that is read-only). This
UI is deployed in the `gloo-fed` namespace, and to open it with `glooctl ui` you will need to upgrade your `glooctl`
version.

1. Some helm values changed as part of consolidating the open source and enterprise charts. In particular, all ratelimit
helm values live under `global.extensions.rateLimit` rather than `rateLimit`. In addition, any `settings` helm values
now live under `gloo.settings` (in the subchart) rather than top-level in `settings`.

The helm values under `apiServer` have been removed and now are under `glooFedApiserver`. For example `apiServer.enable`
is now `glooFedApiserver.enable`.

The following helm values are no longer supported by `glooFedApiserver`:

- `apiServer.enterprise`
- `apiServer.enableBeta`
- `apiServer.deployment.extraApiServerLabels`
- `apiServer.deployment.sslSecretName`
- `apiServer.deployment.server.grpcPort`
- `apiServer.deployment.server.oauth`
- `apiServer.deployment.server.grpcPort`
- `apiServer.service.serviceType`

### Upgrade prerequisites
You will need to have the following command line utilities installed:
 - [helm](https://github.com/helm/helm), either version 2.x or 3.x
 - [hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey) (optional, used to confirm upgrade was zero-downtime)
 - `glooctl` version 1.5.0+ (optional)
 

#### Setup

Install Gloo Edge or Gloo Edge Enterprise v1.5.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Gloo Edge" %}}
```shell script
helm upgrade gloo gloo/gloo --namespace gloo-system --version 1.5.0 --install --create-namespace
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Gloo Edge Enterprise" %}}
```shell script
helm upgrade gloo glooe/gloo-ee --namespace gloo-system --version 1.5.0 --set license_key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY --install --create-namespace
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

#### Adding Optional Upstream for Downtime Testing

<details><summary>If you wish to test downtime using hey, add an upstream for hey to ping. 
You'll need to apply some yaml for the 'with downtime check' commands to work in subsequent sections. Click to expand.</summary>

First add the upstream.
```shell script
apiVersion: gloo.solo.io/v1
kind: Upstream
metadata:
  name: json-upstream
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  static:
    hosts:
      - addr: jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
        port: 80
```

Then make it routable:
```shell script
apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: test-prefix
  namespace: gloo-system
spec:
  virtualHost:
    routes:
      - matchers:
         - prefix: /posts
        routeAction:
          single:
            upstream:
              name: json-upstream
              namespace: gloo-system
        options:
          autoHostRewrite: true
```

To ensure that the the upstream works, wait until the following returns:
```shell script
curl $(glooctl proxy url)/posts
```

```shell script
  ... # omitted for brevity, this will be at the end of a long output
  {
    "userId": 10,
    "id": 100,
    "title": "at nam consequatur ea labore ea harum",
    "body": "cupiditate quo est a modi nesciunt soluta\nipsa voluptas error itaque dicta in\nautem qui minus magnam et distinctio eum\naccusamus ratione error aut"
  }
]
``` 
</details>

#### Upgrading the Gloo Edge deployment to v1.6
Run whichever upgrade command is appropriate for your setup:

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Gloo Edge" %}}
```shell script
helm upgrade gloo gloo/gloo --namespace gloo-system --version 1.6.0
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Gloo Edge with downtime check" %}}
```shell script
hey -n 6000 -c 10 -q 10 $(glooctl proxy url)/posts & helm upgrade gloo gloo/gloo --namespace gloo-system --version 1.6.0 --set gatewayProxies.gatewayProxy.podTemplate.probes=true
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab name="Gloo Edge Enterprise" %}}
```shell script
helm upgrade gloo glooe/gloo-ee --namespace gloo-system --version 1.6.0 --set license_key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Gloo Edge Enterprise with downtime check" %}}
```shell script
hey -n 6000 -c 10 -q 10 $(glooctl proxy url)/posts & helm upgrade gloo glooe/gloo-ee --namespace gloo-system --version 1.6.0 --set license_key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY --set gatewayProxies.gatewayProxy.podTemplate.probes=true
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}



#### Verify v1.6 upgrade 
If you chose to run hey alongside the upgrade command for a downtime check, then the hey command will spend a minute pinging gloo before 
printing diagnostic data like this:

You should expect less than 20 errors at most, and a healthy response time histogram that's mostly under .25 seconds.
</details>

Next, let's verify that gloo was actually upgraded as expected by checking the installed version: 

```shell script
glooctl version
```

You should see the expected version for all the server components.

Let's also check that your Gloo Edge installation is healthy by running:

```shell script
glooctl check
```

If everything has gone smoothly, it will state that all the deployments are ok and that no problems were detected.

### Manually Transition from v2 to v3.

Gloo Edge's default helm configurations for v1.6 and v1.7 will smoothly transistion from v2 to v3. However, if you have
manually edited any bootstrap configurations, you may need to remove v2 references yourself by removing the 
following config value wherever it is has been added:

```shell script
envoy.reloadable_features.enable_deprecated_v2_api: true
```

See [Envoy's documentation for more info](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/faq/api/envoy_v3). 

#### Upgrading the Gloo Edge deployment to v1.7
Once you've installed gloo v1.6, you should be able to upgrade to v1.7 without downtime by 
following similar steps to the previous upgrade.

{{< tabs >}}
{{% tab name="Gloo Edge" %}}
```shell script
helm upgrade gloo gloo/gloo --namespace gloo-system --version 1.7.0
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Gloo Edge with downtime check" %}}
```shell script
hey -n 6000 -c 10 -q 10 $(glooctl proxy url)/posts & helm upgrade gloo gloo/gloo --namespace gloo-system --version 1.7.0 --set gatewayProxies.gatewayProxy.podTemplate.probes=true
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab name="Gloo Edge Enterprise" %}}
```shell script
helm upgrade gloo glooe/gloo-ee --namespace gloo-system --version 1.7.0 --set license_key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Gloo Edge Enterprise with downtime check" %}}
```shell script
hey -n 6000 -c 10 -q 10 $(glooctl proxy url)/posts & helm upgrade gloo glooe/gloo-ee --namespace gloo-system --version 1.7.0 --set license_key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY --set gatewayProxies.gatewayProxy.podTemplate.probes=true
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

#### Verify v1.7 upgrade
Verify the upgrade as before with glooctl and hey. If you once again see no issues, then the upgrade is complete!
