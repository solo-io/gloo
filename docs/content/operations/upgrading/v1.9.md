title: 1.9.0+ Upgrade Notice
weight: 50
description: Upgrading to Gloo Edge 1.9.x and Gloo Edge Enterprise 1.9.x
---

Follow these steps to upgrade your Gloo Edge or Gloo Edge Enterprise deployments to version 1.9 from version 1.8. If
your Gloo Edge deployment runs a version older than 1.8, make sure to [upgrade to 1.8]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/v1.8" >}}) before upgrading to 1.9.

This upgrade guide assumes that you installed Gloo Edge with Helm or `glooctl`. You can verify this installation by checking for a Helm chart release named `gloo` in the output of `helm ls --all-namespaces`.

For steps to avoid downtime during upgrades, check out the [Recommended settings]({{< versioned_link_path fromRoot="/operations/upgrading/upgrade_steps#upgrading-the-server-components" >}}).

## CRD field updates

Any new fields added to our CRDs (e.g. added between 1.8.0 -> 1.9.0) need to be added to our validation schemas.

To apply the new CRDs:
```
helm pull gloo/gloo --version $GLOO_VERSION --untar #e.g. GLOO_VERSION=1.9.0
kubectl apply -f gloo/crds
```

{{% notice note %}}
To support Kubernetes 1.22, Gloo Edge CRDs are now written with the `v1` rather than the `v1beta1` API. CRDs that persisted as `v1beta1` are converted to the new `v1` API when read in Kubernetes 1.22.

## Verify upgrade
To verify that your upgrade was successful, let's first check the version:

```shell script
glooctl version
```

You should see the expected version for all the server components.

Let's also check that your Gloo Edge installation is healthy by running:

```shell script
glooctl check
```

If everything went well, you should see the following output:

```shell script

Checking pods... OK
Checking upstreams... OK
Checking upstream groups... OK
Checking auth configs... OK
Checking rate limit configs... OK
Checking VirtualHostOptions... OK
