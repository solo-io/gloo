Before you begin, this guide assumes that you have the following setup.

1. [Install Gloo Gateway](https://docs.solo.io/gloo-edge/latest/installation/gateway/kubernetes/) in the `gloo-system` namespace.
2. Enable [discovery mode for Gloo Gateway](https://docs.solo.io/gloo-edge/latest/installation/advanced_configuration/fds_mode/). If not, make sure that you created any Upstream resources with the appropriate functions.
3. Install the `glooctl` command line tool.
4. Identify the URL of the gateway proxy that you want to use for this guide, such as with the `glooctl proxy` command. Note that if you are testing in a local cluster such as Kind, you must use the custom localhost port that you configured instead of `glooctl proxy`, such as `http://localhost:31500`.
