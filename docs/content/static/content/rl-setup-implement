Place the descriptor and action configurations into the appropriate Gloo Edge custom resources to implement rate limiting. You can choose between referring to a RateLimitConfig resource (Enterprise-only) or entering the descriptors and actions directly into the resources. For more information about implementation options, see the [Rate limiting setup guide](https://docs.solo.io/gloo-edge/main/guides/security/rate_limiting/setup/#implement).
