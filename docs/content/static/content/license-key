To run the Enterprise Edition, you must [install](https://docs.solo.io/gloo-edge/latest/installation/enterprise/) or [upgrade](https://docs.solo.io/gloo-edge/latest/operations/upgrading/) Gloo Gateway with an enterprise license key. Contact your Solo Account Representative for a license key. To request a trial, [fill out this request form](https://www.solo.io/free-trial/) and check **Gloo Gateway**.
