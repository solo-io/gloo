A Proxy is a container for the entire set of configuration that will to be applied to one or more Proxy instances.
Proxies can be understood as a set of listeners, represents a different bind address/port where the proxy will listen
for connections. Each listener has its own set of configuration.

If any of the sub-resources within a listener is declared invalid (e.g. due to invalid user configuration), the
