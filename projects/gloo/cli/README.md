# Installation

---

#### Install the CLI

To get the latest `glooctl` binary for your platform, simly run

```bash
curl -sL https://run.solo.io/gloo/install | sh
```

Which will download `glooctl` and place it in `$HOME/.gloo/bin`.

Add `$HOME/.gloo/bin` to your `PATH` for easy access to `glooctl`.

If you prefer to download `glooctl` manually, a list of releases can be found 
on our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases)

---

#### Upgrade the CLI

Once you have installed `glooctl`, you can use it to upgrade `glooctl` (and your installation) without 
any other steps.

Usage:
```bash
  glooctl upgrade [flags]
```

Aliases:
```bash
  upgrade, ug
```

Flags:
```bash
  -h, --help             help for upgrade
      --path string      Desired path for your upgraded glooctl binary. Defaults to the location of your currently executing binary.
      --release string   Which glooctl release to download. Specify a git tag corresponding to the desired version of glooctl. (default "latest")
```

#### Install Gloo on Kubernetes

Gloo can be easily installed to kubernetes with the command

```
glooctl install kube
```

This will deploy Gloo and all of its components to the `gloo-system` namespace.

If you are using the Enterprise version of Gloo, you'll need to install
Gloo by passing authorized Docker Hub credentials to the CLI like so:

```bash
glooctl install kube \
    --docker-email=YOUR_EMAIL \
    --docker-username=YOUR_USERNAME \
    --docker-password=YOUR_PASSWORD 
```

To verify the installation succeeded:
```bash
kubectl get pod -n gloo-system

NAME                             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
discovery-77467d765f-7jbtx       1/1       Running   0          1d
gateway-676d756695-nvkj2         1/1       Running   0          1d
gateway-proxy-596c4bd9f7-2vn47   1/1       Running   0          1d
gloo-665d768998-ph9sj            1/1       Running   0          1d
rate-limit-7ffc67c798-8cvv2      1/1       Running   0          1d
redis-66db7fdf56-d9ntd           1/1       Running   0          1d

```
---

#### Uninstall Gloo from Kubernetes

To uninstall Gloo, simply delete the `gloo-system` namespace with `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl delete namespace gloo-system
```
---


# Upstreams

Upstreams represent destinations for routing with Gloo. Upstreams 
are typically associated with a some information that resolves to a set 
of network addresses for a service, or account information for a supported 
cloud provider. 

Some upstreams will be automatically discovered by Gloo's
Discovery service. 

Upstreams can describe details about gRPC and RESTful applications 
for fine-grained routing on the function level with Gloo.

---
#### List Upstreams

```bash
glooctl get upstream
```

usage: `glooctl get upstream [NAME] [--namespace=namespace] [-o FORMAT] [-o FORMAT]`

Use `glooctl create upstream [command] --help` for more information about a command.


---
#### Create Aws Upstreams

```bash
glooctl create upstream aws
```

Use `glooctl create upstream aws -i` for interactive mode.

AWS Upstreams represent a set of AWS Lambda Functions for a Region that can be routed to with Gloo. AWS Upstreams require a valid set of AWS Credentials to be provided. These should be uploaded to Gloo using `glooctl create secret aws`

Usage:

```bash
  glooctl create upstream aws [flags]
```

Flags:
```bash
      --aws-region string                                       region for AWS services this upstream utilize (default "us-east-1")

```

---
#### Create Azure Upstreams

```bash
glooctl create upstream azure
```

Use `glooctl create upstream azure -i` for interactive mode.

Azure Upstreams represent a set of Azure Functions for a Function App that can be routed to with Gloo. Azure Upstreams require a valid set of Azure Credentials to be provided. These should be uploaded to Gloo using `glooctl create secret azure`

```

---
#### Create Consul Upstreams

```bash
glooctl create upstream consul
```

Use `glooctl create upstream consul -i` for interactive mode.

Consul Upstreams represent a collection of endpoints for Services registered with Consul. Typically, Gloo will automatically discover these upstreams, meaning you don't have to create them. However, if upstream discovery in Gloo is disabled, or ACL permissions have not been granted to Gloo to read from the registry, Consul services can be added to Gloo manually via the CLI.

Usage:
```bash
  glooctl create upstream consul [flags]
```

Flags:
```bash
      --consul-service string         name of the service in the consul registry
      --consul-service-tags strings   tags for choosing a subset of the service in the consul registry
  -h, --help                          help for consul
      --service-spec-type string      if set, Gloo supports additional routing features to upstreams with a service spec. The service spec defines a set of features
```

Global Flags:
```bash
  -i, --interactive        use interactive mode
      --name string        name of the resource to read or write
  -n, --namespace string   namespace for reading or writing resources (default "gloo-system")
  -o, --output string      output format: (yaml, json, table)
```


---
#### Create Kubernetes Upstreams

```bash
glooctl create upstream kube
```

Use `glooctl create upstream kube -i` for interactive mode.


Kubernetes Upstreams represent a collection of endpoints for Services registered with Kubernetes. Typically, Gloo will automatically discover these upstreams, meaning you don't have to create them. However, if upstream discovery in Gloo is disabled, or RBAC pe0rmissions have not been granted to Gloo to read from the registry, Kubernetes services can be added to Gloo manually via the CLI.

Usage:
```bash
  glooctl create upstream kube [flags]
```

Flags:
```bash
  -h, --help                            help for kube
      --kube-service string             name of the kubernetes service
      --kube-service-labels strings     labels to use for customized selection of pods for this upstream. can be used to select subsets of pods for a service e.g. for blue-green deployment
      --kube-service-namespace string   namespace where the kubernetes service lives (default "defaukt")
      --kube-service-port uint32        the port were the service is listening. for services listenin on multiple ports, create an upstream for each port. (default 80)
      --service-spec-type string        if set, Gloo supports additional routing features to upstreams with a service spec. The service spec defines a set of features
```

Global Flags:
```bash
  -i, --interactive        use interactive mode
      --name string        name of the resource to read or write
  -n, --namespace string   namespace for reading or writing resources (default "gloo-system")
  -o, --output string      output format: (yaml, json, table)
```



---
#### Create Static Upstreams

```bash
glooctl create upstream static
```

Use `glooctl create upstream static -i` for interactive mode.

Static upstreams are intended to connect Gloo to upstreams to services (often external or 3rd-party) running at a fixed IP address or hostname. Static upstreams require you to manually specify the hosts associated with a static upstream. Requests routed to a static upstream will be round-robin load balanced across each host.

Usage:
```bash
  glooctl create upstream static [flags]
```

Flags:
```bash
  -h, --help                       help for static
      --service-spec-type string   if set, Gloo supports additional routing features to upstreams with a service spec. The service spec defines a set of features 
      --static-hosts strings       list of hosts for the static upstream. these are hostnames or ips provided in the format IP:PORT or HOSTNAME:PORT. if :PORT is missing, it will default to :80
      --static-outbound-tls        connections Gloo manages to this cluster will attempt to use TLS for outbound connections. Gloo will automatically set this to true for port 443
```

Global Flags:
```bash
  -i, --interactive        use interactive mode
      --name string        name of the resource to read or write
  -n, --namespace string   namespace for reading or writing resources (default "gloo-system")
  -o, --output string      output format: (yaml, json, table)
```


---
#### Delete Upstreams

```bash
glooctl delete upstream NAME
```

Deletes an upstream from Gloo's catalog. If the upstream was created by 
Discovery, this will not prevent the upstream from being re-generated.

Aliases:
```bash
  upstream, u, us, upstreams
```

Flags:
```bash
  -h, --help   help for upstream
```

Global Flags:
```bash
  -i, --interactive        use interactive mode
      --name string        name of the resource to read or write
  -n, --namespace string   namespace for reading or writing resources (default "gloo-system")
```

# Virtual Services

Virtual Services represent a logical service presented to the 
outside world on the gateway level. When clients communicate with the 
Gateway managed by Gloo, they specify the virtual service they 
wish to interact with by the domain name in their requests. This 
maps to the `Host` header in HTTP1, and the `:authority` header in 
HTTP2.

Virtual services route client requests to upstreams, optionally providing 
additional transport features such as retries, rate limiting, request transformation, 
and more. 

Virtual services are defined by an ordered list of routes 
and the set of domains for which they apply. Domains cannot 
overlap between virtual services or Gloo will report an errored 
configuration.

---
#### List Virtual Services


```bash
`glooctl get virtualservice [NAME] [--namespace=namespace] [-o FORMAT]`
```

Aliases:
```bash
   virtualservice, vs, virtualservices
```

Available Commands:
```bash
  route       get a list of routes for a given virtual service
```

  -h, --help   help for virtualservice
```

Global Flags:
```bash
  -i, --interactive        use interactive mode
      --name string        name of the resource to read or write
  -n, --namespace string   namespace for reading or writing resources (default "gloo-system")
  -o, --output string      output format: (yaml, json, table)
```


---
#### Create Virtual Services

Create a virtual service to start adding routes. You can choose to skip 
this step and go directly to adding routes. If you do, a basic virtual service 
will be created for you.

```bash
glooctl create virtualservice
```

Usage:
```bash
  glooctl create virtualservice [flags]
```

Aliases:
```bash
  virtualservice, vs, virtualservice, virtualservices
```

Flags:
```bash
      --domains strings               comma seperated list of domains
      --enable-rate-limiting          enable rate limiting features for this virtual service
  -h, --help                          help for virtualservice
      --name string                   name of the resource to read or write
  -n, --namespace string              namespace for reading or writing resources (default "gloo-system")
      --rate-limit-requests uint32    requests per unit of time (default 100)
      --rate-limit-time-unit string   unit of time over which to apply the rate limit (default "MINUTE")
```

Global Flags:
```bash
  -i, --interactive     use interactive mode
  -o, --output string   output format: (yaml, json, table)
```


---
#### Delete Virtual Services

This will delete all routes that have been added to the virtual service.

usage: `glooctl delete virtualservice [NAME] [--namespace=namespace]`

Usage:
```bash
  glooctl delete virtualservice [flags]
```

Aliases:
```bash
  virtualservice, v, vs, virtualservices
```

Flags:
```bash
  -h, --help   help for virtualservice
```

Global Flags:
```bash
  -i, --interactive        use interactive mode
      --name string        name of the resource to read or write
  -n, --namespace string   namespace for reading or writing resources (default "gloo-system")
```



---


# Secrets

Secrets contain private data (access keys, passwords, etc.) that 
should not be stored in configuration objects like Upstreams and Virtual Services.

Instead, Secrets are their own kind of object (usually backed by Kubernetes Secrets, with Vault integration supported).

`glooctl` provides some convenience commands for creating secrets with ease.

---
#### Create AWS Credentials Secret

Create an AWS secret with the given name. If no flags are provided, 
the default profile will be read from `~/.aws/credentials` and used 
to generate the secret for Gloo to read.

Usage:
```bash
  glooctl create secret aws [flags]
```

Flags:
```bash
      --access-key string   aws access key
  -h, --help                help for aws
      --name string         name of the resource to read or write
  -n, --namespace string    namespace for reading or writing resources (default "gloo-system")
      --secret-key string   aws secret key
```

Global Flags:
```bash
  -i, --interactive     use interactive mode
  -o, --output string   output format: (yaml, json, table)
```

---
#### Create TLS Secret

The TLS secret contains the root certificate, private key, and cert chain necessary 
for encrypting TCP traffic. TLS secrets must be provided to Gloo to configure Virtual Services 
to use SSL.

Usage:
```bash
  glooctl create secret tls [flags]
```

Flags:
```bash
      --certchain string    filename of certchain for secret
  -h, --help                help for tls
      --privatekey string   filename of privatekey for secret
      --rootca string       filename of rootca for secret
```

Global Flags:
```bash
  -i, --interactive     use interactive mode
  -o, --output string   output format: (yaml, json, table)
```




---


# Routes

Add HTTP routes to a virtualservice using the `glooctl add route` command.

Adding routes in *interactive* mode is recommended for beginners.
Simply run `glooctl add route -i` to use interactive mode.

---
#### Add Routes
