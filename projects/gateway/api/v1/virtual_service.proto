/*
*
* The **VirtualService** is the root Routing object for the Gloo Gateway.
* A virtual service describes the set of routes to match for a set of domains.
*
* It defines:
* - a set of domains
* - the root set of routes for those domains
* - an optional SSL configuration for server TLS Termination
* - VirtualHostPlugins that will apply configuration to all routes that live on the VirtualService.
*
* Domains must be unique across all virtual services within a gateway (i.e. no overlap between sets).
*
* VirtualServices can delegate routing behavior to the RouteTable resource by using the `delegateAction` on routes.
*
* An example configuration using two VirtualServices (one with TLS termination and one without) which share
* a RouteTable looks as follows:
*
* ```yaml
* # HTTP VirtualService:
* apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
* kind: VirtualService
* metadata:
*   name: 'http'
*   namespace: 'usernamespace'
* spec:
*   virtualHost:
*     domains:
*     - '*.mydomain.com'
*     - 'mydomain.com'
*     routes:
*     - matcher:
*         prefix: '/'
*       # delegate all traffic to the `shared-routes` RouteTable
*       delegateAction:
*         name: 'shared-routes'
*         namespace: 'usernamespace'
*
* ```
*
* ```yaml
* # HTTPS VirtualService:
* apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
* kind: VirtualService
* metadata:
*   name: 'https'
*   namespace: 'usernamespace'
* spec:
*   virtualHost:
*     domains:
*     - '*.mydomain.com'
*     - 'mydomain.com'
*     routes:
*     - matcher:
*         prefix: '/'
*       # delegate all traffic to the `shared-routes` RouteTable
*       delegateAction:
*         name: 'shared-routes'
*         namespace: 'usernamespace'
*   sslConfig:
*     secretRef:
*       name: gateway-tls
*       namespace: gloo-system
*
* ```
*
* ```yaml
* # the RouteTable shared by both VirtualServices:
* apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
* kind: RouteTable
* metadata:
*   name: 'shared-routes'
*   namespace: 'usernamespace'
* spec:
*   routes:
*     - matcher:
*         prefix: '/some-route'
*       routeAction:
*         single:
*           upstream:
*             name: 'some-upstream'
*      ...
* ```
*
* **Delegated Routes** are routes that use the `delegateAction` routing action. Delegated Routes obey the following
* constraints:
*
* - delegate routes must use `prefix` path matchers
* - delegated routes cannot specify header, query, or methods portion of the normal route matcher.
* - `routePlugin` configuration will be inherited from parent routes, but can be overridden by the child
*
