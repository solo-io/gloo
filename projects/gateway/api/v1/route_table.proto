/*
*
* The **RouteTable** is a child routing object for the Gloo Gateway.
*
* A **RouteTable** gets built into the complete routing configuration when it is referenced by a `delegateAction`,
* either in a parent VirtualService or another RouteTable.
*
* Routes specified in a RouteTable must have their paths start with the prefix provided in the parent's matcher.
*
* For example, the following configuration:
*
* ```
* virtualService: mydomain.com
* match: /a
* delegate: a-routes
* ---
* routeTable: a-routes
* match: /1
*
* ```
*
* would *not be valid*, while
*
* ```
* virtualService: mydomain.com
* match: /a
* delegate: a-routes
* ---
* routeTable: a-routes
* match: /a/1
*
* ```
*
* *would* be valid.
*
*
* A complete configuration might look as follows:
*
* ```yaml
* apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
* kind: VirtualService
* metadata:
*   name: 'any'
*   namespace: 'any'
* spec:
*   virtualHost:
*     domains:
*     - 'any.com'
*     routes:
*     - matchers:
*       - prefix: '/a' # delegate ownership of routes for `any.com/a`
*       delegateAction:
*         ref:
*           name: 'a-routes'
*           namespace: 'a'
*     - matchers:
*       - prefix: '/b' # delegate ownership of routes for `any.com/b`
*       delegateAction:
*         ref:
*           name: 'b-routes'
*           namespace: 'b'
* ```
*
* * A root-level **VirtualService** which delegates routing to to the `a-routes` and `b-routes` **RouteTables**.
* * Routes with `delegateActions` can only use a `prefix` matcher.
*
* ```yaml
* apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
* kind: RouteTable
* metadata:
*   name: 'a-routes'
*   namespace: 'a'
* spec:
*   routes:
*     - matchers:
*       # the path matchers in this RouteTable must begin with the prefix `/a/`
*       - prefix: '/a/1'
*       routeAction:
*         single:
*           upstream:
*             name: 'foo-upstream'
*
*     - matchers:
*       - prefix: '/a/2'
*       routeAction:
*         single:
*           upstream:
*             name: 'bar-upstream'
* ```
*
* * A **RouteTable** which defines two routes.
*
* ```yaml
* apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
* kind: RouteTable
* metadata:
*   name: 'b-routes'
*   namespace: 'b'
* spec:
*   routes:
*     - matchers:
*       # the path matchers in this RouteTable must begin with the prefix `/b/`
*       - regex: '/b/3'
*       routeAction:
*         single:
*           upstream:
*             name: 'bar-upstream'
*     - matchers:
*       - prefix: '/b/c/'
*       # routes in the RouteTable can perform any action, including a delegateAction
*       delegateAction:
*         ref:
*           name: 'c-routes'
*           namespace: 'c'

* ```
*
* * A **RouteTable** which both *defines a route* and *delegates to* another **RouteTable**.
*
*
* ```yaml
* apiVersion: gateway.solo.io/v1
* kind: RouteTable
* metadata:
*   name: 'c-routes'
*   namespace: 'c'
* spec:
*   routes:
*     - matchers:
*       - exact: '/b/c/4'
*       routeAction:
*         single:
*           upstream:
*             name: 'qux-upstream'
* ```
*
* * A RouteTable which is a child of another route table.
*
*
* Would produce the following route config for `mydomain.com`:
*
* ```
* /a/1 -> foo-upstream
* /a/2 -> bar-upstream
* /b/3 -> baz-upstream
* /b/c/4 -> qux-upstream
* ```
*
