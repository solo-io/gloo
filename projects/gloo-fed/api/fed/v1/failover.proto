/*
    FailoverSpec is the core portion of the API for enabling failover between Gloo Upstreams in gloo-fed.
    This API is heavily inspired by the Failover API present in the Gloo Upstream which can be found in
    `api/gloo/v1/upstream`.

    The source Upstream below is the initial primary target of traffic. The type of endpoints vary by the type
    of Upstream specified. Each target specified is then configured as a failover endpoint in the case that
    the prmiary Upstream becomes unhealthy. The priority of the failover endpoints is inferred from the
    order in which the Upstreams are specified. source = [0], targets = [1-n].

    Example:

        primary:
          cluster: primary
          name: primary
          namespace: primary
        failover_groups:
        - priority_group:
          - cluster: A
            upstreams:
            - name: one
              namespace: one
          - cluster: B
            upstreams:
            - name: two
              namespace: two
        - priority_group:
          - cluster: C
            upstreams:
            - name: one
              namespace: one
          - cluster: D
            upstreams:
            - name: two
              namespace: two
