name: Unit Tests

# This workflow invokes unit tests for the Gloo Gateway project
# It was introduced during the 1.17 quarter, where we added a new project (projects/gateway2)
# and therefore we only run those new tests here
#
# Our historical unit tests are run via CloudBuild
# Overtime, it would be valuable to consolidate these approaches
