# Code Generation

To run the full codegen process, use `make -B install-go-tools generated-code`. In most cases it is not necessary to run all sub-targets within `generated-code`.

Here is a description of each sub-target and its purpose:

| Target                     | Description                                                                                                                    | Use when...                                                                          | Approximate runtime                  |
