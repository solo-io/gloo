changelog: 
- type: FIX
  description: |
    Updated HTTP tunneling plugin to support HTTP CONNECT tunneling on all Upstreams, not just
    those bound to a Route. This allows Upstreams referenced by various settings (e.g. remote JWKS, 
    tracing, and more) to use a forward proxy without creating a Route for each Upstream.
