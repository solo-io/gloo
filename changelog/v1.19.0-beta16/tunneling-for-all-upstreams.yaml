changelog: 
- type: FIX
  description: |
    Updated HTTP tunneling plugin to support HTTP CONNECT tunneling on all Upstreams, not just
    those bound to a Route. This allows Upstreams referenced by various settings (e.g. remote JWKS, 
    tracing, and more) to use a forward proxy without creating a Route for each Upstream.

    To address clusters having their own lifecycle that differs from listeners in 
    gateway2 causing issues with the HTTP tunneling configuration, a new plugin interface
    for creating additional clusters and listeners from Upstreams has been added.
    The additional clusters and listeners are added to the snapshot near the 
    end of the gateway2 translations process.
