      gateway2/status: use SetStatusCondition to prevent duplicate conditions

      Currently, we append() Conditions while building the status reports.
      This can result in duplicate Condition.Type in the list that is
      incorrect and will lead to API errors. This change uses
      SetStatusCondition API that correctly updates the condition if the
      same Type already exists in the list.
