  description: >-
    Allow configuring secrets resource clients with multiple underlying source clients.
    This will allow Gloo Edge to List and Watch secrets from any number of the currently
    supported sources (i.e. Directory, Kubernetes, Vault). It is the responsibility of
    the user to ensure there are no namespace+name collisions across all configured sources.
