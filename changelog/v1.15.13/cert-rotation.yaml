    description: >- 
      Make cert rotation more resilient against downtime when mTLS is enabled, by updating
      the certs in stages and waiting for changes to propagate. A new helm value `gateway.certGenJob.rotationDuration`
      (default 65s) can be used the configure the duration to wait for each stage of cert rotation to complete. This
      value must be tuned according to the performance of the specific environment in which the jobs are run.
