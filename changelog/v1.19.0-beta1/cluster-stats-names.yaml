    description: >-
      When using the Kubernetes Gateway API and routing to Kubernetes Services or Kubernetes Upstreams, the
      envoy cluster stats names are now in a new more parseable format that allows us to extract info about
      the Service: `upstreamName_upstreamNs_svcNs_svcName_svcPort` (underscore-separated). Note that as long
      as Kubernetes Gateway integration is enabled (i.e. Gloo Gateway is installed with `kubeGateway.enabled=true`),
      both Edge and Kubernetes Gateway proxies will use the new stats name format for these clusters.
