      Update envoy-gloo to enable support for setting span names via the transformation filter.

    description: >-
      Change the image used in our kubernetes/e2e tests from kennship/http-echo
      to jmalloc/echo-server. This image supports http/2. It is also smaller and
      faster, which may speed up our e2e tests and reduce CI costs.
      kennship/http-echo is also an archived project that appears to not have
      been updated in 6 years.

      This change was also made necessary by the fact that the test was timing
      out and failing because it was taking too long to download the
      `kennship/http-echo` image.
