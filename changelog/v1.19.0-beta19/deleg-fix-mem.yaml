      gateway2/delegation: ignore child routes with mismatched parentRef early

      After the refactor to decouple querying of routes from translation
      to enable KRT integration, the resolution of child routes for a
      delegating route became too permissive, leading to massive amount
      of memory usage when there are cyclic references to namespaces,
      i.e., a parent route delegating to wildcard routes in the parent
      route's namespace. This happens even if a child route does not
      attach to the parent because this check was omitted during the
      initial route chain construction. Without this check, the recursive
      nature of evaluating a delegation chain can consume massive amount
      of memory.

      This change prunes the routes in the chain early on to avoid
      this problem, as this is a regression from 1.17.x. While we could
      prune the child route list further, it would degrade the performance
      due to O(N^2) computation required to match all the rules in a child
      route with all the rules on the parent, which already happens later
      in the translation. To reduce the risk of introducing new bugs,
      we defer other optimizations for the future.

      Testing done:
      Verified that the memory usage remains stable with the
      repro config provided in solo-io/solo-projects#8119
