      This adds the initial support for IPv6.
      - Added IP family management (`DnsIpFamily`) via `Settings.UpstreamOptions.DnsLookupIpFamily` and `U`pstream.DnsLookupIpFamily`.
      - Upstreams such as static, aws and azure inherit the global setting unless overridden at the Upstream level.
      - In memory upstreams generated for kube services can be managed via an annotation `gloo.solo.io/dns_ip_family`. This can also be managed globally via `UpstreamOptions.GlobalAnnotations`.
  - type: HELM

      - Chart values expose a new field `.Values.global.globalIpFamily` to manage IP family.
      - `globalIpFamily` is used in `settings.yaml` to manage the global values. It takes the following options: v6, v4, dual-v4-pref, dual-v6-pref, dual.
      - Proxy bootstrap configuration `gateway-proxy-configmap.yaml` and `gateway-proxy-deploy.yaml` are updated to handle the v6 listeners and probes.
      - Deprecation warning for `gatewaySettings.ipv4Only`. Preferred option is `.Values.global.globalIpFamily`.
