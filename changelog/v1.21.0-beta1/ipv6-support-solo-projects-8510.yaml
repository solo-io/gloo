      This adds the initial support for IPv6.
      - Exposes IP family management (`DnsIpFamily`) via `Settings.UpstreamOptions.DnsLookupIpFamily`  and `Upstream.DnsLookupIpFamily` for DNS lookup.
        `DnsLookupIpFamily` under `Upstream` helps to manage it at the upstream level but other will inherit the global configuration under `Settings`.
      - This applies to upstreams such as static, aws, and azure.

      - Chart values expose `settings.upstreamOptions.ipv4Only` to manage V4 or V6 family
      - Adds `upstreamOptions.dnsLookupIpFamily` to settings.yaml template to manage the IP family globally.
      - Proxy bootstrap configuration `gateway-proxy-configmap.yaml` and `gateway-proxy-deploy.yaml` are updated to handle the V6 listeners and probes.
