      This adds the initial support for IPv6.
      - Exposes IP family management (`DnsIpFamily`) via `Settings.UpstreamOptions.DnsLookupIpFamily`  and `Upstream.DnsLookupIpFamily` for DNS lookup.
        `DnsLookupIpFamily` under `Upstream` helps to manage it at the upstream level but other will inherit the global configuration under `Settings`.
