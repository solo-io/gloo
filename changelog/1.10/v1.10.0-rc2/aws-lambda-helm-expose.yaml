  description: >
    Adds lambda option to persist original request info that otherwise is lost.
    Defaults to false to avoid leaking potentially sensitive info.
    Similar to envoy's x-forwarded-for header and may be desirable to be false when 
    envoy is in a mesh deployment.
    Implemented here to allow for usage of original request path in access logs.
- type: FIX

  resolvesIssue: false
  description: >
    Add new sts refresh timer in addition to filewatch. The extra overhead is
    countered by the fact that file events sometimes seem to be lost. The
    new behavior is only applied if the refresh time is set and should mitigate
    instances of stale credentials.
