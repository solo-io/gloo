    description: >-
      When setting up our kind cluster for tests, we need to ensure that the correct version of the k8sgateway APIs are loaded, as
      we support multiple versions of Istio that use different versions of the rapidly changing k8sgateway APIs.
      To support this, `k8sgateway_api_version` has been added to the the min/max environment variables for the test matrix
      and the value are set as the `CONFORMANCE_VERSION` environment variable when running the setup-kind script.
