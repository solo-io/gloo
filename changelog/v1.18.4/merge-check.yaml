      gateway2: use safer merging to avoid assuming zero values as being unset

      The legacy Edge code uses ShallowMerge() which can undesirably overwrite
      zero values mistaking them for unset values. RouteOptions merging in
      GatewayV2 uses the same API, but this can result in undesirable effects
      if the merging considers zero valued fields as being unset. To avoid
      this, the options merging used by GatewayV2 relies on a safer merge
      that only allows merging of values that can be set to Nil (pointers,
      slices, maps, etc.) which works since all user-facing fields on the
      RouteOptions are nil-able. Functionally, this is the same as before
      due to all fields being nil-able, but is a bit clearer to readers.
      Moreover, trying to merge a non-nil field will panic which can catch
      potential misuse of the API.
