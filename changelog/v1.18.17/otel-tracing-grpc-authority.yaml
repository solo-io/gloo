    description: |
      Add support for setting the authority field on gRPC requests made to OTEL Collectors during tracing.
      When the authority field is set, the gRPC client will use the specified value as the :authority header
      when making requests to the collector. This is useful when the collector is behind a reverse proxy that
      requires a specific authority to be set on incoming requests.
