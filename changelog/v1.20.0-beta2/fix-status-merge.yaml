      gateway2/status: correctly merge parentRefs for routes

      When a route has multiple parentRefs, the exitsing status
      merging code does not correctly merge parentRefs belonging
      to different proxies. As a result, a route with multiple
      parents does not have both parents in their status during
      merging of status reports.

      This change fixes it.
