      Remove GraphQL support from Gloo Gateway. GraphQL functionality has been fully removed 
      after being deprecated in v1.18.0. Any existing GraphQL routes will return a 501 Not 
      Implemented response. The GraphQL CRDs, client code, discovery functionality, and route 
      processing have been removed.
