    description: >-
      Remove GraphQL support from Gloo Gateway. GraphQL functionality has been fully removed 
      after being deprecated in v1.18.0. The GraphQL CRDs, client code, discovery functionality, and route 
      processing have been removed.  Some proto files remain to prevent future use of these names and fields.
