      gateway2: allow route delegation using wellknown label

      There is a product requirement to enable users to use
      a label to select HTTPRoutes to delegate to instead
      of GVK ref to other HTTPRoutes (includes wildcards).

      To strike a balance between flexibility and performance,
      this change implements the proposal to use a well known
      label `delegation.gateway.solo.io/label=<value>` to
      allow users to delegate to other HTTPRoutes using a label.
      HTTPRoutes are indexed using this well known label key that
      enable O(1) lookups of routes matching this label value.
