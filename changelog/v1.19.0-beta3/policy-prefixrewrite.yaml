    description: |
      When merging parent-child policies, the merging should allow child
      policies to augment parent policies such that fields unset on the
      parent can be set by the child. There is a bug when using policy
      override capability with route delegation that disallows this when
      the annotation specifies non-wildcard fields, such that even if
      a field is unset by the parent only the fields specified in the
      override annotation are merged in - which is incorrect because
      the annotation only applies to fields that are being overriden
      (set by the parent). This change fixes the bug.
