      There's a bug in how cycles are detected when evaluating a
      delegation chain, because of which a multi-level delegation
      tree with the same child route being referenced by multiple
      parent HTTP routes is broken. This change fixes the detection
      of cycles during the evaluation of the delegation chain.
