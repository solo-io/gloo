    description: >-
      Gloo Gateway controller metrics and xds/krt snaphots are now collected and included 
      the test failure artifacts. 
      After encountering some test failures that proved difficult to debug without knowing more
      about the state of the cluster, we have added additional artifacts to be collected when
      a test fails.
      This will help us to more easily diagnose the cause of test failures.
