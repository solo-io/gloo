      Added the ability to control if resource status metrics are no longer reported after deletion.
      If a resource was invalid and deleted, a status metric indicating a problem was left behind.
      This could lead to confusion and false alarms.
      
      Setting `.Values.gloo.clearStatusMetrics` to `true` will result in metrics 
      for deleted resources no longer being reported.
      This may cause metric scraping to infrequently not see status metrics.
