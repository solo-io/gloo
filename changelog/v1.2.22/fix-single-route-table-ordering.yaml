  description: >
    Gloo currently sorts routes that originate from a single route table. This is not intended behavior. Gloo should
    sort routes only when a route delegates to multiple route tables, because in these cases we want to avoid
    short-circuiting (e.g. having `/foo` come before `/foo/bar`). This change fixes the behavior and adds a new
    `alwaysSortRouteTableRoutes` setting for users who might be depending on the current behavior. If this flag is set
    to `true` (default is `false`), it will force Gloo to sort the routes even when they come from a single route table.
