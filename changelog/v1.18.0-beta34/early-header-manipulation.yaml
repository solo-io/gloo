changelog:
  - type: NEW_FEATURE
    issueLink: https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/9604
    description: >-
      Added support for early header manipulation on Gateways.
      This feature allows headers to be manipulated before significant processing 
      and routing decisions.
      It affords the ability to add or remove headers that affect request processing
      and can be used to implement override headers.
      This can be configured by setting the
      `gateway.spec.httpGateway.options.httpConnectionManagerSettings.earlyHeaderMutation` field.
      The headersToAdd field will add key-value pair headers to the request if not already 
      present or overwrite them unless append is set to true.
      The headersToRemove field removes the specified headers and is processed after 
      the headers have been added.
