changelog:
  - type: NON_USER_FACING
    description: >-
      Change the image used in our kubernetes/e2e tests from kennship/http-echo
      to jmalloc/echo-server. This image supports http/2. It is also smaller and
      faster, which may speed up our e2e tests and reduce CI costs.
      kennship/http-echo is also an archived project that appears to not have
      been updated in 6 years.

      This change was also made necessary by the fact that the test was timing
      out and failing because it was taking too long to download the
      `kennship/http-echo` image. See
      [here](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/actions/runs/11693450838/job/32565060282?pr=10123)
      for a sample run.
