      Setting the `uuidRequestIdConfig` in the `HttpConnectionManagerSettings` now correctly sets the `RequestIdExtension` in the `HttpConnectionManager` filter.

      Previously, setting the `uuidRequestIdConfig` in the `HttpConnectionManagerSettings` would lead to the listener being rejected with the error `Didn't find a registered implementation for type: 'hcm.options.gloo.solo.io.HttpConnectionManagerSettings.UuidRequestIdConfigSettings'`.
