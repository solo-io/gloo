      Add `PERSIST_INSTALL` environment variable to control Gloo installation while running e2e tests (both new and old versions).
      If set to `true`, the the installation of Gloo will be skipped if it is already installed, and will install Gloo if not already
      installed. When set to `true`, teardown will also be skipped.

      The TEAR_DOWN flag will now also be usable with the new kubernetes e2e tests, and common logic is now beign used to control
      Gloo installtion and teardown for both new and old e2e tests.
