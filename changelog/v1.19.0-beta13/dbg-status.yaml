      gateway2/status: preserve external conditions

      There is a requirement to allow external controllers to update
      the statuses on Gateway objects by writing Conditions that do
      not conflict with the Types owned by the Gateway. Currently, only
      condition.Types that are a part of the status reporter are set as
      the final list of conditions. This change allows external controllers
      to write Condition.Types that do not conflict.
