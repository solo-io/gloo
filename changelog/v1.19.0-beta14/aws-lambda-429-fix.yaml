    description: >-
      Previously, Gloo did not provide any means to determine whether a request
      to an AWS Lambda upstream was rate-limited. With this fix, if the AWS
      Lambda upstream responds to Gloo with a HTTP 429, Gloo will return an
      HTTP 500 response to the client and set the
      `x-envoygloo-lambda-statuscode` and `x-envoygloo-lambda-statusreason`
      headers. The `statuscode` header will be set to `429` to indicate the
      value received from the Lambda upstream, and the `statusreason` header
      will be set as described in the
      [Lambda
      documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/api/API_Invoke.html)).
