    description: >-
      dummy release to workaround sum.golang.org caching the wrong checksum for v1.20.0-rc3.
      The initial release build failed because of the bitnami docker image no longer exists. Fixed
      that removed the tag and re-release but sum.golang.org already cache the checksum of the old
      failed release tag.
