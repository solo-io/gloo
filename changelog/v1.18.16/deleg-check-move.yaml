      gateway2/delegation: check cyclic reference only for valid children

      - Moves the cyclic reference check after ignoring unattached candidate
        child routes to prevent an unnecessary status error when the parent delegates
        to wildcard routes in the same namespace.

      - Removes the self-reference check so that invalid references to self
        are reported as status errors.
