CVE-2023-2253

# These CVEs only impacts install of Gloo-Edge from Glooctl CLI.
# It only leads to a panic if there is a misconfigured / malicious helm plugin installed
# and can be easily resolved by removing the misconfigured / malicious plugin
# The helm bump will require bumping the k8s dependencies by +2 minor versions that can cause issues.

CVE-2024-26147

# Ignore a few istio.io/istio vulnerabilities. These CVEs are from very old versions of istio for which patches have already been merged - these come up as false positives from trivy because we pin the dependencies and trivy is unable to determine that the pinned versions already have the fix. This is due to istio's tags not following go's strict semver and therefore falling back to a go pseudo version.
