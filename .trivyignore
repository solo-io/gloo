CVE-2022-1996

# These CVEs only impacts install of Gloo-Edge from Glooctl CLI.
# Also Helm module is used in testing, which has no impact on exploitation.
# Gloo-Edge data and control planes are not impacted at all by the helm module.
# Glooctl is not a long running program, and does not affect future uses of Glooctl.

# Ignore this vulnerability; it does not affect the gateway-proxy image.
# No handlers exposed by the control plane fall victim to this attack

CVE-2023-2253

# These CVEs only impacts install of Gloo-Edge from Glooctl CLI.
# It only leads to a panic if there is a misconfigured / malicious helm plugin installed
# and can be easily resolved by removing the misconfigured / malicious plugin
# The helm bump will require bumping the k8s dependencies by +2 minor versions that can cause issues.

CVE-2024-26147

# Ignore a few istio.io/istio vulnerabilities. These CVEs are from very old versions of istio for which patches have already been merged - these come up as false positives from trivy because we pin the dependencies and trivy is unable to determine that the pinned versions already have the fix. This is due to istio's tags not following go's strict semver and therefore falling back to a go pseudo version.

CVE-2022-23635

# Ignore go stdlib vulnerability. Go bump to 1.22.7 in N-1 branches cover this, but older versions we aren't concerned
# about updating as it shouldn't affect us
CVE-2024-34156

# This CVE affects the imroc/req dependency which is used in go-utils
# go-utils exclusively uses this package to upload security scans to Github and as such the vulnerability does not
# impact Gateway functionality
# This dependency is removed in go-utils v0.27.0, so this entry can be removed once all LTS branches are on that version
# or later
CVE-2024-45258

# These CVEs affect the packc/pgx dependency which is used in ext-auth-service
# The dependency is exclusively used in the monetization feature which we don't believe any customer uses and which is
# set to be deprecated
# Nevertheless the CVEs have been addressed in the v1.15 LTS branch and later, however it is impractical to resolve in 1.14
# due to a number of other requisite dependency bumps
# Therefore we include this entry for now and should remove it once 1.14 is no longer an LTS branch

CVE-2024-27304

# https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5fhx-39r8-3jwh
# This is resolved in versions of Gloo Gateway that rely on Go1.22 and above (1.17, 1.18)
# For earlier versions of Gloo Gateway, we confirmed that the vulnerability is not exploitable
# and captured our findings here: https://github.com/solo-io/solo-projects/issues/7157#issuecomment-2463252858
