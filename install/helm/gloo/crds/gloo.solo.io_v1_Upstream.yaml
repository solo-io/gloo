          description: Upstreams represent destination for routing HTTP requests.
            Upstreams can be compared to [clusters](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/api/v2/cds.proto)
            in Envoy terminology. Each upstream in Gloo has a type. Supported types
            include `static`, `kubernetes`, `aws`, `consul`, and more. Each upstream
            type is handled by a corresponding Gloo plugin. (plugins currently need
            to be compiled into Gloo)
