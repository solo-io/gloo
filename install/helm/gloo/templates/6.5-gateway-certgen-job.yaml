# Resources created as hooks are not considered part of a release by Helm. This means that they
# will not be cleaned up when running `helm uninstall`. The ways to get around this are documented here:
# https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts_hooks/#hook-resources-are-not-managed-with-corresponding-releases).
# These will not work for us though: we can't use `hook-delete-policy` since we have multiple hooks that depend
# on each other (RBAC resources needed by the job), and we cannot write a job to clean them up as this would result
# in a catch-22 (this second job would in turn need its own RBAC resources and who would clean up those?).
#
# To be able to clean up these hook resources, which are needed only temporarily during the pre-install phase,
# we redefine them as `post-install` hooks with a `hook-delete-policy`. This way Helm will reapply them and
# immediately delete them after the installation completes. Note that we have to explicitly define a `before-hook-creation`
# policy as well, to avoid failing on existing resources (`before-hook-creation` is the default `hook-delete-policy`
# if none is specified`).
#
