# How to use this?
see example in yamls.yaml

Run like so

```
go run main.go apply -f yamls.yaml --iterations 3000
```
This will apply the template in yamls.yaml 3000 times.
The template has an `.Index` variable you can use.

For example, for a pod, you would have:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: app-{{.Index}}
  namespace: gloo-system
  labels:
    app: app-{{.Index}}
    test: test1
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: registry.k8s.io/pause:3.6
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "1Mi"
        cpu: "1m"
    ports:
      - containerPort: 8080
```

this will create pods name `app-0`, `app-1`,...

You can also:
- use `--dry-run` to just print yamls.
- adjust `--qps` and `--burst` as well.
- If your broke the cluster, you can use `--start` to continue from where you left off.

By default, objects will not be overridden. This is because
that a common failure mode here is that the cluster stops responding. When the cluster recovers you don't need to re-create the same object, so a simple create is enough. To change this behavior use `--force` to first delete objects and then re-create them.

To clean up (just delete the objects), pass the `--delete` flag.

If you are still not hitting the QPS set, try adding the `--async` flag to have requests going in parallel (you can also adjust `--workers`).

## Caveat

The template is parsed on the field level. This means that the input files must be valid yaml files. This is because the yaml is parsed **before** the template is evaluated.
Only after the yaml is parsed, we go over all the fields and evaluate the templates on each field.

This is a technical limitation is due to trying to give a similar experience to `kubectl apply`.
