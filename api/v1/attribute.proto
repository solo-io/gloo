/**
 * An attribute is a container for configuration that is intended to be applied across a set of labeled resources inside of Gloo.
 * Attributes specify a set of selectors which are compared with labels by Gloo at runtime
 * In the current implementation, only Listeners have be selected, and therefore configured by Attributes.
 * Labels and Selectors follow the same logical patterns implemented by Kubernetes.
 * Read about the Kubernetes concepts here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/
 * Attributes are useful when applying shared configuration to a large number of objects, such as the sharing of route
 * configuration between roles.
